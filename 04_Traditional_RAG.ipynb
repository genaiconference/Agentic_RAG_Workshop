If the\\npre-authorization is not done, you must collect all reports and discharge card when you get discharged. Please make sure that you\\nsign the hospital bill before leaving the hospital. You can then submit the claim along with all the necessary supporting documents\\nto TPA as a reimbursement .

Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations,\\nincluding state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our\\ncustomers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying\\nmalicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other\\ninfrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social\\nengineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other\\nsensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\\' or customers\\' data, or acting in a\\ncoordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-\\nsponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our\\ncustomers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing\\nconflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized\\naccess to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access\\nwhen no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\\' security or\\nsystems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware\\nthrough software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.  \\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of\\ndetecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities\\nor new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats\\ncan have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of\\nour partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our\\nsystems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of\\ntheir data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming\\nour reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to\\nransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of\\nattacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware\\ncan be introduced to a software provider\\'s customers, including us, through software updates.  \\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and\\ntechnologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers\\nusing methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI\\nmodels in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal\\nsecurity controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations\\nin jurisdictions worldwide.  \\n### Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\\' data  \\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers\\' decisions to purchase or use our products or\\nservices across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us\\nwhose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also\\naffect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including\\nhardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of\\ntheir data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services,\\nincluding many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\\' on-premises\\nor cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero day\") vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early\\ncalendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product\\ncan persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if\\nthe attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1A\" -->  \\ncustomers\\' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace\\ndigital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our\\nusers\\' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security\\npractices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious\\nsoftware impacting a customer\\'s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source\\nsoftware into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products\\nsusceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because\\ngenerative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that\\nrely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.  \\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may\\ninclude systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and\\nproducts, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result,\\nwe may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a\\nmore secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase\\nour customers\\' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our\\ntechnology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state\\nof the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical\\nsophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these\\nsettings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability\\nto review and reset these defaults.  \\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We\\nare committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have\\nactionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and\\nsupport on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks\\nfor all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves\\non-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\\'\\ncomputing environments.  \\n### Development and deployment of defensive measures  \\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\\' systems,\\nwe must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability\\nfeatures, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well\\nas those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when\\nsoftware updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network,\\nproducts, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and\\ninformation about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries\\nsuch as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we\\nmust engineer our products and services.  \\nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail\\nto do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues,\\nor reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products\\nor subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting\\ntheir existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers,\\nand third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating\\nsystems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt\\nadequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived\\nvulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit\\nour exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve\\ncommercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.  \\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem\\nof third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting\\nit, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  \\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow\\nthe number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",

Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Business\" and Part II, Item 7\\nof this Form 10-K under the heading \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Forward-looking statements provide\\ncurrent expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For\\nexample, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company\\'s business and results of operations are\\nforward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as \"future,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\"\\n\"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"may,\" and similar terms.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental\\ndamage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.  \\n###### Cloud Services  \\nThe Company\\'s cloud services store and keep customers\\' content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.  \\n###### Digital Content  \\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books,\\nmusic, video, games and podcasts.  \\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized\\nfitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News-₱, a subscription news and magazine\\nservice; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.  \\n###### Payment Services  \\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment service.  \\n##### Segments  \\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\\'s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan\\nand Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater\\nChina includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\\'s other\\nreportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to\\nbetter align with the location of the Company\\'s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.  \\n##### Markets and Distribution  \\nThe Company\\'s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company\\nalso employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company\\'s\\nnet sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.  \\n##### Competition  \\nThe markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure\\non gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price\\nand performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many\\nof the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and\\ninfringing on its intellectual property.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous\\nsoftware applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem,\\nmarketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The\\nCompany faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as\\nestablished hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\\'s competitors have broader product lines, lower-\\npriced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered\\nproduct margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\\'s\\nservices compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The\\nCompany faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single\\nor limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\\nwearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\\nindustry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom\\ncomponents available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields\\nhave matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if\\nsuppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements.  \\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.  \\n##### Research and Development  \\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends\\nheavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to\\ndevelop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\"R&D\"), licensing of\\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.  \\n##### Intellectual Property  \\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services.\\nThis includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such\\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  \\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing,\\nand is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual\\nproperty rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\\'s products and services. The Company believes\\nthe duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.  \\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\\'s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties.\\nIt may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\\'s products, processes and services. While the Company has\\ngenerally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on\\nreasonable terms or at all.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Business Seasonality and Product Introductions  \\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.\\nAdditionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can\\nalso impact the Company\\'s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel\\ninventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate\\na product introduction.  \\n##### Human Capital  \\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\\nmembers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.  \\n###### Workplace Practices and Policies  \\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.  \\n###### Compensation and Benefits  \\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\\'s success. The Company\\nrecognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and\\npersonal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to\\nsupport employees\\' individual growth and development.  \\n###### Inclusion and Diversity  \\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to\\nwork to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.  \\n###### Engagement  \\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment\\nwhere everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the\\nCompany conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.  \\n###### Health and Safety  \\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to\\nmitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place\\nfor those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and\\ncustomers through its global security team.  \\n##### Available Information  \\nThe Company\\'s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections\\n13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\\nSuch reports and other information filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx\\nwhen such reports are available on the SEC\\'s website. The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com,\\nand its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental,\\nsocial and governance matters, and details related to the Company\\'s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this\\nForm 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\\'s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 4\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n#### Item 1A. Risk Factors  \\nThe Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or\\nunknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of\\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.  \\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not\\nbe considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.  \\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.  \\n##### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  \\n###### The Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales. In addition, the Company\\'s global\\nsupply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a\\nresult, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.  \\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations,\\ncan adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, consumer\\nconfidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or\\nasset values, and other economic factors.  \\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\\'s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can\\nhave a significant impact on the Company\\'s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners,\\nand developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and\\nother financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial\\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### The Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can\\nharm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\\'s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or\\nexports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\\'s ability to offer and distribute\\nits products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company\\nderives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions,\\nincluding changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\\'s operations in\\naccordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s operations. Such restrictions\\ncan be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example,\\ntensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\\'s business. If\\ndisputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer\\nconfidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\\'s business.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that\\nare prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\\nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\\'s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\\nnatural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain,\\nand result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an\\ninterruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.\\nBecause the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources\\nwould exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\\'s suppliers are required\\nto maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the\\nCompany\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely\\naffected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the\\nimposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products\\nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current\\nproducts and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.  \\n####### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\\nbusinesses.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous\\nsoftware applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will\\nachieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks\\nand copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating\\nthe Company\\'s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the\\nCompany\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these\\nmarkets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content\\nsupplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\\'s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.\\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources,\\nexperience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall.  \\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to\\noffer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s\\napproach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.  \\nThe Company\\'s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service\\nofferings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with\\nillegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.  \\nThe Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\\'s ability to continually improve its products and services\\nto maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\\neffectively.  \\n##### Business Risks  \\n###### To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.  \\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services,\\nand successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\\nnumber of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\\'s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and\\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\\'s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory\\nlevels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that\\nnew products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions\\nand transitions of products and services.  \\n###### The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.  \\nSubstantially all of the Company\\'s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single\\nlocations. Changes or additions to the Company\\'s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company\\nhas also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\\'s\\ndirect control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of\\nproducts manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\\'s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these\\npartners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-\\nwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to\\nadhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business,\\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners\\nprimarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\\'s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative\\nimpact on the Company\\'s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can\\nbe disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict,\\neconomic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.  \\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of\\nits suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing\\npartners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the\\nrecoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.  \\n##### Future operating results depend upon the Company\\'s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.  \\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations\\nthat can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the\\npast experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer\\nfrom poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\\'s ability to\\nobtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\\'s\\nsuppliers, described in \"The Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic\\nconditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition,\" above, can also affect the Company\\'s ability to\\nobtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company\\'s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity\\nconstraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at\\nacceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead\\nof components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements. When the Company\\'s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or\\nconstrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\\'s business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition. The Company\\'s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.  \\n##### The Company\\'s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation.  \\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating\\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware\\nor software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the\\nCompany\\'s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\\'s products are\\nintroduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\\'s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience\\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\\'s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer\\nexpectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to\\ndo so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to\\nproduct liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant\\nwarranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\\'s\\nproducts and services, and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\\nservices, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.  \\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net\\nrealizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived\\nassets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\\' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may\\nnot be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset\\nexceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently\\nrecoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of\\nproduct obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.  \\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations\\ncover the Company\\'s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\\'s markets are volatile,\\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient\\namounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.  \\n##### The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\\'s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights\\nof others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on\\nexperience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable\\nterms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\\nthird-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition.  \\n##### The Company\\'s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.  \\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.\\nThere can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\\'s products. If third-party\\nsoftware applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\\'s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\\'s products.  \\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\\' perception and analysis of\\nthe relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\\'s products compared to competitors\\' platforms, such as\\nAndroid for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be\\nbased on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product\\nsales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.  \\nThe Company\\'s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\\nsoftware for the Company\\'s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\\' products with larger market\\nshare. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\\'s devices can suffer.  \\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\\'s products and\\noperating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers\\nand lower customer demand for the Company\\'s products.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they\\ngenerate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From\\ntime to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory\\nrequirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as\\nthe European Union (\"EU\") Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and\\ninvestigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\\'s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\\nChanges have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could\\nalso affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what\\nextent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of\\nsales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced,\\nor if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\\'s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party\\ncontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\\'s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be\\nfor relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party\\ncontent providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\\'s access to, or increase the\\ncost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.  \\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and\\nmay fail to appeal to the Company\\'s customers.  \\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the\\nCompany may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such\\nsolutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.  \\n##### The Company\\'s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\\'s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.  \\nMuch of the Company\\'s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including\\nits Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition\\nfor their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\\'s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce\\ndynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nculture, reputation and operational flexibility.  \\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect\\nthe Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\n##### The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute\\nproducts and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to\\nconsumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.  \\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\\'s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\\' purchases of the device.\\nThere can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\\' stores with Company employees\\nand contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The\\nfinancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\\'s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of\\nthe Company\\'s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\\'s products.  \\n##### The Company\\'s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.  \\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or\\nnetwork disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or\\nelectronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may\\nbe ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\\'s or its vendors\\' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such\\nfailures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\\'s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\\'s online services, interfering with\\ncustomer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\\'s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\n##### Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.  \\nThe Company\\'s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\\'s customers and\\nemployees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended\\nto protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information\\noccur and could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company\\'s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also\\nexposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is\\nprovided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\\'s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases\\nof, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of\\noperations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise\\nthe confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\\'s ability\\nto attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\\'s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the\\nCompany to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to\\ncontinue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid\\ndetection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\\'s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks\\nagainst the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.  \\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries,\\nthe Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores\\nand processes.  \\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these\\nsecurity measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty\\npassword management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\\'s or its vendors\\' employees or customers into\\ndisclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\\'s or its vendors\\' systems and\\nservices. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services\\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer\\norders or impede customer access to the Company\\'s products and services.  \\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\\'s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties,\\nincluding distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges\\nassociated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant\\nwrite-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all,\\nor the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\\'s ability to fully realize\\nthe anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\n##### The Company\\'s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  \\nThe Company\\'s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\\'s business, results of\\noperations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\\'s\\nability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with\\nfluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.  \\n##### Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks  \\n###### The Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.  \\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet\\nbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions\\nwhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased\\nover time and may continue to increase.  \\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future,\\nincluding as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek\\nroyalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously\\ndefending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek\\ninjunctions and substantial damages.  \\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive\\nto the Company\\'s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve\\nsuch challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also\\nsignificantly increase the Company\\'s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\\'s ability\\nto offer certain products and services.  \\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Legal Proceedings\" and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements in Note 12, \"Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\" under the heading \"Contingencies,\" in the opinion of management, there\\nwas not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.  \\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third\\nparty in a reporting period for amounts above management\\'s expectations, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could\\nbe materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or\\nprofits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to\\nchange its business practices and limit the Company\\'s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims\\nthat may arise.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n###### The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\\'s business.  \\nThe Company\\'s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data\\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and\\ninfringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital\\ncontent; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and\\ncash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste,\\nrecycling, product design and climate change.  \\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\\'s business by\\nincreasing the Company\\'s costs, limiting the Company\\'s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\\'s\\nproducts and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\\'s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\\'s supply chain and its business.\\nNew and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may\\nincrease as the Company\\'s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has\\nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\\'s employees,\\ncontractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\\'s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and\\nregulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other\\nactions that materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively\\nmitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products.\\nAlthough the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such\\npolicies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\\'s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited\\nfrom importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\n###### Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\\'s business.  \\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition,\\nthe Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and\\nother communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and\\nuncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\\'s control. The Company cannot guarantee\\nthat it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\\'s goals\\nand initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or\\ninternational environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and\\nregulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n###### The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.  \\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and\\nregulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store,\\nsuch as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how\\ndevelopers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company\\ncharges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to\\ncommunicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the\\nCompany that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition. For\\nexample, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in\\nadverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of\\nwhich could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the\\nApp Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\\'s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.  \\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation\\nthat, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with\\nother companies to offer their search services on the Company\\'s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government\\ninvestigations and legal proceedings.  \\nThere can be no assurance the Company\\'s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations,\\nlitigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\\'s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with\\nother legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\\'s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for\\nusers of the Company\\'s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced\\ndemand for products and services, and lost sales.  \\n####### The Company\\'s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.  \\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types\\nof personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company\\nand its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or\\nhave laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices.\\nNoncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.  \\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements\\nand other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international\\nprivacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to\\nreputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.  \\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data\\nare subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the\\nCompany\\'s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is\\nhandled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\\'s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or\\ngovernment investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.  \\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the\\nCompany can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data\\nsecurity standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails\\nto follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Financial Risks  \\n###### The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.  \\nThe Company\\'s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\\'s\\nproducts and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\\'s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of\\nfactors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures;\\nincreased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages;\\npotential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix,\\nincluding to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and\\nother macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other\\nfactors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.\\nAdditionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a\\nsignificant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could\\nalso be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\\'s products or services, issues with new product or service\\nintroductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\\'s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing\\npartners.  \\n###### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses\\nworldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past\\nbeen adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign currency-denominated sales and\\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for\\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the\\nU.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign currency-denominated sales and\\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting\\ngross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange\\nrates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.  \\n###### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk,\\nsovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may\\nfluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future\\nfluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n###### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also\\nsells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\\nCompany\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\\nportion of the Company\\'s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and collectibility\\nrisk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor\\nnon-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products\\nfor the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company\\'s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few\\nindividual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade\\nreceivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.  \\n###### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are\\norganized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to\\nsignificant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax\\nrules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with\\ndiffering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\\nThe application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\\ndetermination of the Company\\'s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### General Risks  \\n###### The price of the Company\\'s stock is subject to volatility.  \\nThe Company\\'s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology\\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways\\nthat may have been unrelated to these companies\\' operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in\\na given period to exceed the stock\\'s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and\\nprofitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its\\ncurrent share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\\'s Board of Directors, and the Company\\'s\\nshare repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\\'s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material\\nadverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.  \\n#### Item 1B.

Properties  \\nThe Company\\'s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions,\\nR&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and\\nequipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.  \\n#### Item 3. Legal Proceedings  \\n##### Epic Games  \\nEpic Games, Inc. (\"Epic\") filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \"District Court\") against the Company alleging violations of\\nfederal and state antitrust laws and California\\'s unfair competition law based upon the Company\\'s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District\\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\\'s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the\\nCompany\\'s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\\'s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from\\nincluding in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\\nstorefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \"Circuit Court\") affirmed the District Court\\'s ruling.\\nOn June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both\\npetitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\\'s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S.\\nSupreme Court denies Apple\\'s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.  \\n##### Masimo  \\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, \"Masimo\") filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the \"ITC\") alleging\\ninfringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a\\npermanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26,\\n2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the \"Order\") prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing\\nfunctionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently\\nexpected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.  \\n##### Other Legal Proceedings  \\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial\\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period\\nfor amounts above management\\'s expectations, the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\naffected.  \\n#### Item 4.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final\\n$4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a\\nminimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans\\ncomplying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.  \\n(2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (\"ASRs\"). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions\\ncommitted to deliver shares of the Company\\'s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total\\nnumber of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted\\naverage price of the Company\\'s common stock during the ASRs\\' purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n###### Company Stock Performance  \\nThe following graph shows a comparison of five-year cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend-reinvested basis, for the Company, the S&P 500\\nIndex and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index. The graph assumes $100 was invested in each of the Company\\'s common stock, the S&P 500 Index\\nand the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index as of the market close on September 28, 2018. Past stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of\\nfuture stock price performance.  \\n<figure>  \\nThis is a comparative analysis of 5-year cumulative total return for three entities: Apple Inc., the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index. The horizontal axis represents time, with annual intervals from September 28, 2018, to September 30, 2023. The vertical axis represents cumulative total return in dollars, ranging from $0 to $400.  \\nThree distinct lines represent the performance of each entity:\\n- Apple Inc. is represented by a solid line.\\n- The S&P 500 Index is represented by a long-dashed line.\\n- The Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index is represented by a short-dashed line.  \\nAll three entities start at the same baseline value of $100 in September 2018. Over the five-year period:\\n- Apple Inc. shows the highest cumulative total return, with a steep increase between 2019 and 2021, peaking above $300, and then continuing to rise, ending close to $350 by September 2023.\\n- The S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index both show positive returns but at a lower magnitude. Both indices rise steadily until 2021, after which they experience a decline, followed by a partial recovery. By September 2023, both indices end below $200, with the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index slightly outperforming the S&P 500 Index.  \\nThe graph demonstrates that over the five-year period, Apple Inc. significantly outperformed both the broader market (S&P 500 Index) and the technology sector benchmark (Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index) in terms of cumulative total return. The performance gap widens especially after 2020, highlighting Apple Inc.\\'s superior growth relative to its peers and the market.\\nCOMPARISON OF 5-YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN\\nAmong Apple Inc., the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index  \\n$400  \\n$300  \\n$200  \\n\\\\-  \\n$100  \\n$0  \\n9/28/18  \\n9/28/19  \\n9/26/20  \\n9/25/21  \\n9/24/22  \\n9/30/23  \\nApple Inc.  \\nS&P 500 Index  \\nDow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index  \\n</figure>  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>September 2018</th>\\n<th>September 2019</th>\\n<th>September 2020</th>\\n<th>September 2021</th>\\n<th>September 2022</th>\\n<th>September 2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Apple Inc.</td>\\n<td>$ 100</td>\\n<td>$ 98</td>\\n<td>$ 204</td>\\n<td>$ 269</td>\\n<td>$ 277</td>\\n<td>$ 317</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>S&amp;P 500 Index</td>\\n<td>$ 100</td>\\n<td>$ 104</td>\\n<td>$ 118</td>\\n<td>$ 161</td>\\n<td>$ 136</td>\\n<td>$ 160</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index</td>\\n<td>$ 100</td>\\n<td>$ 105</td>\\n<td>$ 154</td>\\n<td>$ 227</td>\\n<td>$ 164</td>\\n<td>$ 226</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Item 6.

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  \\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-\\nK. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022.

Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage.  \\n######## Services Gross Margin  \\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies\\nrelative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.  \\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\\ndollar, partially offset by a different Services

federal income tax rate</td>\\n<td>21 %</td>\\n<td>21 %</td>\\n<td>21 %</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\nThe Company\\'s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign\\nearnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.  \\nThe Company\\'s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign\\ntax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.  \\n###### Liquidity and Capital Resources  \\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along\\nwith cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over\\nthe next 12 months and beyond.  \\nThe Company\\'s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:  \\n####### Debt  \\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the\\n\"Notes\"), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.  \\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion\\nof commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.  \\n####### Leases  \\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30,\\n2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.  \\n####### Manufacturing Purchase Obligations  \\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\\'s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished\\nproducts. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\nmanufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\\'s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily\\nnoncancelable.  \\n####### Other Purchase Obligations  \\nThe Company\\'s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing,\\nand noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the\\nCompany had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.  \\n####### Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable  \\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Act\") was $22.0 billion, with\\n$6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n####### Capital Return Program  \\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a\\nminimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\\'s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend\\non an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  \\n###### Critical Accounting Estimates  \\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and the Company\\'s\\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\'s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect\\nthe amounts reported. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\ndescribes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its\\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  \\n####### Uncertain Tax Positions  \\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\\'s uncertain tax positions involves significant\\njudgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\\'s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final\\noutcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\\'s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and\\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\\'s expectations could have a\\nmaterial impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results.  \\n####### Legal and Other Contingencies  \\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The\\nCompany records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant\\njudgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition\\nand operating results.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  \\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however,\\nthey may still impact the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.  \\n###### Interest Rate Risk  \\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\\'s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest\\nrates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\\'s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\\'s term debt. To protect against\\ninterest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt\\nportfolios.  \\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\\'s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would\\nresult from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument</th>\\n<th>Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase</th>\\n<th>Potential Impact</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n<th>2022</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Investment portfolio</td>\\n<td>100 basis points, all tenors</td>\\n<td>Decline in fair value</td>\\n<td>$ 3,089</td>\\n<td>$ 4,022</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Term debt</td>\\n<td>100 basis points, all tenors</td>\\n<td>Increase in annual interest expense</td>\\n<td>$ 194</td>\\n<td>$ 201</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  \\nThe Company\\'s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in\\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\nFluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\\'s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the\\nCompany may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not\\nhedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.  \\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The\\nVAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\'s foreign currency\\nderivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in\\nfair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\n####### Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\n######## Basis of Presentation and Preparation  \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial\\nstatements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial\\nstatements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\\'s presentation.  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every\\nfive or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal year 2023\\nspanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\\nperiods refer to the Company\\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.  \\n######## Revenue  \\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.  \\n######## Share-Based Compensation  \\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.  \\n######## Cash Equivalents  \\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.  \\n######## Marketable Securities  \\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.  \\n######## Inventories  \\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.  \\n######## Property, Plant and Equipment  \\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.  \\n######## Derivative Instruments  \\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \\n######## Income Taxes  \\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.  \\n######## Leases  \\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n####### Note 2 - Revenue  \\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is\\ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are\\ntransferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales,\\ncontrol transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or\\ncommencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\\nCompany\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\"). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs.\\nWhen observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations\\nwould be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may\\nvary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for\\nsimilar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified up tothree performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the\\ntime of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third\\nperformance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each\\ndevice. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\\nobservable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the\\ndelivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue\\nallocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated\\nperiod they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company\\ndoes not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered\\nservices. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based\\non the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including\\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For\\nthird-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company\\naccounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n<th>2022</th>\\n<th>2021</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone (1)</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n<td>$ 205,489</td>\\n<td>$ 191,973</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac (1)</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n<td>40,177</td>\\n<td>35,190</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad (1)</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n<td>29,292</td>\\n<td>31,862</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n<td>41,241</td>\\n<td>38,367</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (2)</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n<td>78,129</td>\\n<td>68,425</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n<td>$ 394,328</td>\\n<td>$ 365,817</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective\\nproduct.  \\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nTotal net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $.5 billion of revenue recognized\\nin 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 26, 2020.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, \"Segment Information and\\nGeographic Data\" for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively.

However, the Company may choose\\nnot to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There\\ncan be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.  \\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged,\\nwhich are generally classified as operating activities.  \\n######## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  \\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these\\ninstruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\\npurchases, typically for up to 12 months.  \\nTo protect the Company\\'s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use\\nforwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023,\\nthe maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions\\nis 19 years.  \\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign\\nexchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in\\nnon-functional currencies.  \\n######## Interest Rate Risk  \\nTo protect the Company\\'s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other\\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.  \\nThe notional amounts of the Company\\'s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n<th>2022</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Foreign exchange contracts</td>\\n<td>$ 74,730</td>\\n<td>$ 102,670</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Interest rate contracts</td>\\n<td>$ 19,375</td>\\n<td>$ 20,125</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Foreign exchange contracts</td>\\n<td>$ 104,777</td>\\n<td>$ 185,381</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe gross fair values of the Company\\'s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\\n<th colspan=\"3\">2022</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges</th>\\n<th>Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges</th>\\n<th>Total Fair Value</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Derivative assets (1):</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Foreign exchange contracts</td>\\n<td>$ 4,317</td>\\n<td>$ 2,819</td>\\n<td>$ 7,136</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Derivative liabilities (2):</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Foreign exchange contracts</td>\\n<td>$ 2,205</td>\\n<td>$ 2,547</td>\\n<td>$ 4,752</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Interest rate contracts</td>\\n<td>$ 1,367</td>\\n<td>$ —</td>\\n<td>$ 1,367</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance\\nSheet.  \\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated\\nBalance Sheet.  \\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company\\'s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses\\ncollateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually\\nestablished thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\\'s\\nderivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022,\\nthe potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\\'s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both\\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.  \\nThe carrying amounts of the Company\\'s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n<th>2022</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Hedged assets/(liabilities):</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Current and non-current marketable securities</td>\\n<td>$ 14,433</td>\\n<td>$ 13,378</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Current and non-current term debt</td>\\n<td>$ (18,247)</td>\\n<td>$ (18,739)</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n####### Accounts Receivable  \\n######## Trade Receivables  \\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company hadone customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for10%. The Company\\'s third-\\nparty cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.

The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the\\nsale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related\\nfinal products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade\\nreceivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to\\ncalculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015,\\neliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The\\nCompany and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"General Court\"). On July 15, 2020, the\\nGeneral Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\\'s decision to the European Court of\\nJustice (the \"ECJ\") and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to\\nclaim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.  \\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As\\nof September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it\\nwill remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the\\n2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\\'s common stock on aone-for-one\\nbasis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of\\ncommon stock.

The\\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material\\nloss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.  \\n###### Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single\\nor limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\\nwearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\\nindustry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom\\ncomponents available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields\\nhave matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if\\nsuppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements.  \\nSubstantially all of the Company\\'s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Note 13 - Segment Information and Geographic Data  \\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like\\nus, whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to or attacks on our own IT\\ninfrastructure, such as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our customers and\\nmay do so in the future. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including\\nhardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of\\ntheir data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services,\\nincluding many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\\' on-premises\\nor cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero-day\") vulnerabilities, such as the attack in\\nearly calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any\\nproduct can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates,\\nor if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise\\ncustomers\\' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace\\ndigital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our\\nusers\\' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security\\npractices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious\\nsoftware impacting a customer\\'s use of our products or services. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software\\nthat may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we increasingly incorporate open source software into our\\nproducts. Additionally, features that rely on generative Al may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from\\nadversaries as we add new generative Al features to our services while continuously developing our understanding of\\nsecurity risks and protection methods in the new field of generative AI.  \\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may\\ninclude systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and\\nproducts, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result,\\nwe may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a\\nmore secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase\\nour customers\\' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our\\ntechnology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-\\nof-the-art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical\\nsophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these\\nsettings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability\\nto review and reset these defaults.  \\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We\\nare committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have\\nactionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and\\nsupport on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks\\nfor all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves\\non-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\\'\\ncomputing environments.  \\nAny of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",

RISK FACTORS\\n\\n Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below,\\nthat could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading\\nprice of our common stock.  \\n### STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS  \\n#### We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  \\n##### Competition in the technology sector  \\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources\\nto small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical,\\nmarketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which\\nwe compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions\\nof new products and services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal\\nto businesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which may adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition, and results of operations.  \\n#### Competition among platform-based ecosystems  \\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many\\nparticipants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,\\napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the\\nmarketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that\\nprovide competing platforms.  \\n· A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements\\nof a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets,\\nsmartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model\\nalso earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications\\nand content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and\\nperformance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware\\nand software products and services. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model may\\nincrease our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.  \\n· We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant\\ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones\\nand tablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device\\nand its platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed\\nby PCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices\\nmay make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing\\nwith operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular\\nproducts or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition,\\nsome of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") partners,\\nwhich may affect their commitment to our platform.  \\n· Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases.\\nThe variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing\\ndecisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching\\nplatforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and\\nensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete\\nwith competitors\\' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\\noperating margins. Competitors\\' rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict\\nour ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business\\nmodel objectives.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",

The Company\\'s reportable segments consist of the\\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe\\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\\'s other reportable\\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\\'s customers and distribution partners and the unique market\\ndynamics of each geographic region.  \\n#### Markets and Distribution  \\nThe Company\\'s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government\\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers\\nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution\\nchannels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company\\'s net\\nsales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.  \\n#### Competition  \\nThe markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price\\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short\\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of\\nthe Company\\'s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating\\nthe Company\\'s products and infringing on its intellectual property.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\\'s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products\\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut\\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products\\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\\'s services compete with business models that provide content to users for\\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition\\nas competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements.  \\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.  \\n#### Research and Development  \\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\\'s\\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products,\\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing\\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\"R&D\"), licensing of\\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.  \\n#### Intellectual Property  \\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware,\\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such\\nintellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such\\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  \\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research,\\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the\\nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single\\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\\'s products and services. The Company believes the\\nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.  \\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\\'s products and services are designed to include\\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various\\naspects of the Company\\'s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such\\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future\\non reasonable terms or at all.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n#### Business Seasonality and Product Introductions  \\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in\\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\\'s net sales to its indirect\\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an\\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.  \\n#### Human Capital  \\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best\\ntalent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its\\npeople can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time\\nequivalent employees.  \\n##### Compensation and Benefits  \\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the\\nCompany\\'s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their\\nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide\\nvariety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.  \\n##### Growth and Development  \\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs\\nthrough Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can\\nalso take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to\\nsupport their well-being.  \\n##### Workplace Practices and Policies  \\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of\\nharassment or discrimination.  \\n###### Inclusion and Diversity  \\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities\\nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and\\nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.  \\n##### Engagement  \\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to\\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee\\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.  \\n##### Health and Safety  \\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace\\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security\\nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard\\nenvironments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers\\nthrough its global security team.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Available Information  \\nThe Company\\'s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\\n\"Exchange Act\"), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

Risk Factors  \\nThe Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of\\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize\\nfrom time to time, the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially\\nand adversely affected.  \\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition,\\npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not\\nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking\\nstatements.  \\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\\nand Results of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.  \\n#### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  \\nThe Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition.  \\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales.\\nIn addition, the Company\\'s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.  \\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher\\ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\naffect demand for the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially\\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\nvalues, and other economic factors.  \\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\\'s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\\'s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics\\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial\\ninstability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods,\\ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly\\nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its\\nrevenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company\\'s products\\nand the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including\\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products,\\nservices and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with\\nnew or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s\\noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company\\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments,\\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company\\'s business. If disputes\\nand conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive\\nand could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in\\ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the\\nCompany\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity\\nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s control. For example, global supply chains\\ncan be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any\\nnegative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such\\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \\n### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  \\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.  \\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP  \\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember 2, 2023  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",

Because of its inherent limitations,\\ninternal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our\\nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.  \\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the\\nframework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\nthe Treadway Commission.

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company\\'s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are\\ncreating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (\"Al\"), that deliver better, faster, and more effective\\nsolutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-\\nsector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.  \\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and\\nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global\\naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees;\\nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing,\\nmarketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.  \\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:  \\n· Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.  \\n· Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial\\ngrowth of 13%.  \\n· Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer\\nsubscribers increased to 67.0 million.  \\n· LinkedIn revenue increased 10%.  \\n· Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.  \\n· Server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services\\ngrowth of 29%.  \\n· Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\"Windows OEM\") revenue decreased 25%.  \\n· Devices revenue decreased 24%.  \\n· Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.  \\n· Xbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.  \\n· Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.  \\n#### Industry Trends  \\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each\\nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform\\nthe industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of\\nresearch and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users,\\nindustry trends, and competitive forces.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"36\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->  \\n#### Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  \\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are\\ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and\\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in\\nthe cloud and, in some cases, the user\\'s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for\\nour software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\\ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.  \\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs\\nand may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter\\nlocations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing\\ndemand for Al services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy,\\nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices\\nare primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability\\nto use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However,\\nsome of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions\\nat these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  \\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university\\nand industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working\\nenvironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\'s career across many different products\\nand businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.  \\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue\\nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates\\nmay significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies\\nreduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.  \\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer\\ndemand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2\\nbillion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses\\nof $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease\\nconsolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter\\nof fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we\\neliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our\\ncapital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we\\nare consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results\\nthrough the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to\\nevaluate our real estate needs.  \\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  \\n#### Seasonality  \\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second\\nquarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending\\nby consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during\\nthe period.  \\n#### Change in Accounting Estimate  \\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments\\nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in\\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from\\nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the\\nperiod June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of\\nthe tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion.  \\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain\\ntaxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion\\nwas held in escrow and restricted from general use.

As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized\\ntax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company\\'s effective tax rate.  \\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2024, 2023\\nand 2022, is as follows (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n<th>2022</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Beginning balances</td>\\n<td>$ 19,454</td>\\n<td>$ 16,758</td>\\n<td>$ 15,477</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year</td>\\n<td>1,727</td>\\n<td>2,044</td>\\n<td>2,284</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year</td>\\n<td>(386)</td>\\n<td>(1,463)</td>\\n<td>(1,982)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year</td>\\n<td>2,542</td>\\n<td>2,628</td>\\n<td>1,936</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities</td>\\n<td>(1,070)</td>\\n<td>(19)</td>\\n<td>(28)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations</td>\\n<td>(229)</td>\\n<td>(494)</td>\\n<td>(929)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ending balances</td>\\n<td>$ 22,038</td>\\n<td>$ 19,454</td>\\n<td>$ 16,758</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign\\njurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain\\nsubject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is\\nreasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between approximately $5 billion and $13 billion in\\nthe next 12 months, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 41\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",

This segment primarily comprises:  \\n· Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (\"Windows OEM\") and other non-volume licensing of the\\nWindows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating\\nsystem, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows\\nIoT.  \\n· Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.  \\n· Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content\\n(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming,\\nadvertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services.  \\n. Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and\\nthird-party affiliates.  \\n### Windows  \\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling\\nconsistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted\\nsignificantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the\\ndevices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:  \\n· The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.  \\n· Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.  \\n· Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.  \\n· Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.  \\n· Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.  \\n· Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts\\nfrom local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows\\nversions licensed.  \\n· Constraints in the supply chain of device components.  \\n· Piracy.  \\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud\\nservices such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for\\nvolume licensing and Software Assurance (\"SA\"), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial\\nrevenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the\\nnumber of PCs sold in a given year.  \\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas,\\nincluding mobile devices and cloud offerings.  \\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating\\nsystems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.  \\n### Devices  \\nWe design and sell devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable\\npeople and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated\\nMicrosoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"13\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->  \\nproductive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product\\nroadmap, and expanding into new categories.  \\n### Gaming  \\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content,\\ncommunity, and cloud services. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of\\nfirst-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios\\nand content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming\\nexperiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a\\ncurated library of over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles.  \\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across\\na variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across\\nsubscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We\\'ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and\\nmobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are focused on\\ngrowing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible.  \\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-\\nenabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified\\napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer\\nbase. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising.\\nGrowth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability\\nof games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices\\nused to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.  \\n### Search and News Advertising  \\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a\\nglobal audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing Chat capabilities are key tools to enable user acquisition and\\nengagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to\\nfirst-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize\\nsearch offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant\\ncontent on advertising offerings.  \\n#### Competition  \\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from\\nApple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security,\\nan easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those\\nthat enable productivity.  \\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination\\nof high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many\\nof which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.  \\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming\\nservices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of\\nentertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from\\nNintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is\\neffectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant\\ninnovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and\\ncontinued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.  \\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like\\nMeta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"14\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->')]"

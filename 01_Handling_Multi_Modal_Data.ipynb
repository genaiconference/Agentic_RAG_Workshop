After treatment, the insured is discharged and pays for the treatment out of pocket. The insured then collects all original documents, receipts, and investigation reports from the hospital. All these original hospital documents, along with a filled claim form, must be submitted to the Third Party Administrator (TPA) within 21 days from the date of discharge.\n\nOnce the TPA receives the claim documents, they acknowledge receipt via email and start the claim process. If additional information is required, the TPA will inform the employee via email and send reminders. If the required documents are not submitted within 30 days, the claim may be closed.\n\nIf the claim is found to be payable, payment will be made to the employee via NEFT. If the claim is declined, a denial email will be sent to the employee.\n\nThis process ensures that all necessary documentation and timelines are followed for claim assessment, with clear communication at each step and defined outcomes based on the claim's status.\nClaim\n\n\n<figure>\n\nInsured visits non network\nhospital for treatment\n\nTakes discharge, pays for\ntreatment\n\nCollects all original\ndocuments, receipts and\ninvestigation reports from\nHospital\n\nSubmits all original\nHospital documents along\nwith filled claim form\nwithin 21 days from date\nof discharge to TPA\n\nTPA acknowledges\nreceipt of claim\ndocuments via email and\ncommences claim process\n\ninformation is required, TPA\nwill inform the employee via\nemail with reminders, If\ndocuments are not\nsubmitted within 30 days,\nclaim may be closed/\n\nIf claim is payable,\npayment will be made to\nemployee via NEFT\n\nIf claim is declined, denial\nmail will be sent.\n\n</figure>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Novartis Group-Employee Benefits Manual 2023-24\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"32\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## Making A Claim Claims Document Check List & Attachments\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Sr. No.</th>\n<th>Document Required (All in ORIGINAL)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Claim intimation is mandatory within 7 days from DOA and before DOD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Main Hospital bills in original (Original Hospital Payment Receipt with serial number, with bill no; signed and stamped by the hospital) &amp; itemized bills.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Discharge Card/Summary (original).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Attending doctors' bills and receipts and certificate regarding diagnosis (if separate from hospital bill) Indoor case papers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Original investigation reports or attested copies of Bills &amp; Receipts for Medicines, Investigations along with Doctors prescription in Original &amp; Laboratory</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Follow-up advice or letter for line of treatment after discharge from hospital, from Doctor.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Break up with details of Pharmacy items, Materials, Investigations even though it is there in the main bill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>In non- network hospitalization, please get the hospital and doctor's registration number in Hospital letterhead and get the same signed and stamped by the hospital.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>In case of accidents, please note FIR or MLC (medico legal certificate) is mandatory.

What should I do when I reach the hospital (NETWORK)?\n\n. These are hospitals where TPA has a tie up for the cashless hospitalization. There are two kinds of network hospitals; PPN Network\nhospitals where cashless services can be obtained for emergency and planned treatments and Standard (Non PPN) network\nhospitals where cashless services can be obtained for planned Hospitalization.\n\n. Once you have reached there, please show your ID card for identification. TPA will also send $a$ letter of credit (on pre-authorization)\nto the hospital to make sure that they extend credit facility. Please complete the pre-authorization procedure listed earlier. If the\npre-authorization is not done, you must collect all reports and discharge card when you get discharged. Please make sure that you\nsign the hospital bill before leaving the hospital. You can then submit the claim along with all the necessary supporting documents\nto TPA as a reimbursement . If, however, you go to a non network hospital , it is still advisable to fill the preauthorization form ( use\nthe copy attached with the Benefits Manual). Please fill the claim form, attach the relevant documents and send it to TPA office for\nreimbursement.\n\n\n### How can I claim my pre & post hospitalization expenses?\n\n. The policy covers pre-hospitalization expenses made prior to 60 days of hospitalization and incurred towards the same illness/\ndisease due to which hospitalization happens. It also covers all medical expenses for up to 60 days post discharge as advised by the\nMedical Practitioner. All bills with summary have to be sent to TPA for reimbursement within 7 days of incurring the expense.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Novartis Group-Employee Benefits Manual 2023-24\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"35\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## Making A Claim(1/2) Things To Remember\n\nAlways aim to pre-authorize your benefits with the TPA\nThis will help you in the following ways:\n\n. You will be informed in advance regarding your coverage for the treatment and whether it is covered under your medical plan or\nnot . This will help you know in advance if your claim may get rejected at a later stage and you do not end up paying out of pocket.\n\n. It will help you ensure that the treatment cost is appropriate and not inflated. as the TPA will be able to cross check costs with the\nhospital in question. This will also help TPA in planning your hospitalization expenditure such that you do not run out of the cover\nthat you are entitled to.\n\n. It will help TPA in registering the impending claim with the insurer\n\nEnsure your dependent list is always updated and claims submitted as per protocols\n\n· Please ensure that all your dependents are covered and have a valid card at the outset itself as it will not be possible to add\ndependents at a later stage. Submit your reimbursement claims within timelines from the hospital. Please do not postpone this till\nlater as it may mean that your claim gets rejected due to late submission .\n\n. Please check that your documents are submitted completely at the first instance itself and originals are submitted wherever\nrequested for . Do note that incomplete submissions will not be considered as exceptions by the insurers and will only delay the\nprocess further for you and a delay may lead to the claim getting closed. Please also retain a copy of all claim documents submitted\nto the insurer\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Novartis Group-Employee Benefits Manual 2023-24\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"36\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## Making A Claim (2/2) Things To Remember\n\nKnow that it is possible that benefits under your plan could be reduced v/s your eligible sum insured\n\nThe following are some common reasons for rejection although these are NOT the only reasons why a claim could be reduced\n\n· Limits for the specific ailment exceed the reasonable cap on ailments listed in the manual,\n\n· Claim amount exceeds the permissible limit under the policy for you ( denied to the extent of the excess),\n\n.

Please remember that on occasion your\npersonal doctor may recommend hospital admission for observation purposes however such admissions are not covered under\nyour medical plan\n\n· Treatment taken is not covered as per policy conditions or excluded, under the policy. Please go through the list of standard\nexclusions listed earlier. (for e.g. : Ailment is a because of alcohol abuse is a standard exclusion, similarly cosmetic treatments or\ntreatments for external conditions like squint correction etc are not covered) .

In 2020, we\ncommitted to being a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.\n\nSince announcing that commitment, we have seen major changes both in the technology sector and in our\nunderstanding of what it will take to meet our climate goals. New technologies, including generative Al, hold promise\nfor new innovations that can help address the climate crisis. At the same time, the infrastructure and electricity needed\nfor these technologies create new challenges for meeting sustainability commitments across the tech sector.\n\nIn May 2024, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress in several areas\nduring fiscal year 2023. In four areas we are on track, and in each of these we see progress that has the potential to\nhave global impact beyond our own sustainability work. These are:\n\n· Reducing our direct operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2).\n\n· Accelerating carbon removal.\n\n· Designing for circularity to minimize waste and reusing cloud hardware.\n\n· Improving biodiversity and protecting more land than we use.\n\nAt the same time, there are two areas where we're not yet on track, and in each of these we are intensively engaged\nin work to identify and pursue additional breakthroughs. These are:\n\n· Reducing our indirect emissions (Scope 3).\n\n· Reducing our water use and replenishing more water than we consume in our datacenter operations.\n\nEven amid the challenges, we remain optimistic. We're encouraged by ongoing progress across our campuses and\ndatacenters, and throughout our value chain.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"6\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n#### Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\n\nIn June 2020, we outlined a series of multi-year commitments designed to address the racial injustice and inequity\nexperienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, including Black and African American communities.\nWe remain committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft,\nin employees' communities, and beyond.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued to collaborate with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to\nadvance projects and programs. We grew our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American\nCommunities program, to help more than 3,000 local organizations in nearly 1,900 Black and African American\ncommunities use technical solutions to modernize and streamline operations. We also expanded our Technology\nEducation and Learning Support (\"TEALS\") program to reach nearly 550 high schools across 21 racial equity expansion\nregions with the support of nearly 1,500 volunteers, 12% of whom identify as Black or African American.\n\nWe have committed $150 million in Minority Depository Institutions and funds supporting Black and African American-\nowned small businesses. These commitments drive sustained impact by directly enabling an increase of funds into\nlocal communities, improving diverse, small-business access to capital, and increasing skill development. We continue\nto partner with diverse-owned banking partners and asset managers to catalyze growth and industry participation.\nAdditionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of\nBlack- and African American-owned suppliers. We have also provided 162 low- or no-interest loans to our small to\nmedium-sized partners through our Partner Capital Fund.\n\nWe also continue to make progress toward our overall commitment to double the number of Black and African American\nand Hispanic and Latinx leaders in the U.S. by 2025.\n\n\n#### Investing in Digital Skills\n\nMicrosoft's Skills for Jobs initiative aims to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and\naccessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs.

Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user\nacquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions.\nIn addition to first-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide\nand monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent\nwith relevant content on advertising offerings.\n\n\n### Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from\nApple and Google, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint competes with CrowdStrike on endpoint security solutions.\nWe believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use\ninterface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable\nproductivity.\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination\nof high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many\nof which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming\nservices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of\nentertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from\nNintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is\neffectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant\ninnovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and\ncontinued strong content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google, OpenAI, and a wide array of websites, social\nplatforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n\n# OPERATIONS\n\nWe have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order\nprocessing, billing, credit and collections, customer lifecycle operations, information processing, and vendor\nmanagement and logistics. The centers in Ireland and Romania support the African, European, and Middle East\nregions; the centers in India and Ireland support the Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta,\nGeorgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond, Washington, Reno,\nNevada, and San Jose, Costa Rica support the Americas regions.\n\nIn addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to\nidentify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the\nevolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for Al services. Our datacenters depend on\nthe availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics\nprocessing units (\"GPUs\") and other components.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we\nhave the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.\nHowever, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended\ndisruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"13\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n# RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n· Cloud and Al - focuses on making IT professionals, developers, partners, independent software vendors,\nand their systems more productive and efficient through development of Azure AI platform and cloud\ninfrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services, Al cognitive\nservices, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n\n· Strategic Missions and Technologies - focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with\ntransformative potential for the future of cloud computing and continued company growth, such as quantum\ncomputing and advanced AI for science.\n\n· Experiences and Devices - focuses on delivering high value end-user experiences across our products,\nservices, and devices, including Microsoft 365, Windows, Microsoft Teams, and the Surface line of devices.\n\n· Microsoft AI - focuses on delivering online experiences targeted at consumers (including Bing, Copilot,\nStart/MSN, and other advertising-based services) and developing advanced Al models.\n\n· Microsoft Security - focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of services that protect our customers'\ndigital infrastructure through cloud platform and application security, data protection and governance,\nidentity and network access, and device management.\n\n· Technology and Research - focuses on fundamental research, product and business incubations, and\nforward-looking Al innovations that span infrastructure, services, and applications. This engineering group\nincludes Microsoft Research, one of the world's largest corporate research organizations, which focuses on\nfundamental research in Al, computer science, and a broad range of other disciplines.\n\n· Linkedin - focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs\nand the way businesses hire, market, sell, and learn.\n\n· Gaming - focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help\ngrow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.\n\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer\ntechnical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and\nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as\npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before\nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide\napplication vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also\ncreate product documentation internally.\n\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally\nto ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and\nhardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing\npatents and currently have a portfolio of over 63,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 23,000 pending\nworldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we\nalso engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees' products.\nFrom time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire\ngroups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At\ntimes, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as\npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting\nand enabling our external development community. Our engagement with open source software also causes us to\nlicense our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.\n\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and\nservices, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially\ndependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"14\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n## Investing in the Future\n\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users,\nto initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad\nadoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we\nbelieve offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our\nassessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a\nwide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI,\ndevices, and operating systems.\n\nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate\nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us\nremain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.\n\nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities,\nand as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the\nresults across the company. This includes continuing to support fundamental research, which provides us with a unique\nperspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation.\n\n\n# DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\n\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and\nresellers. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises\nand public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation\nrequirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and\nother partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our\nproducts and services.\n\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they\nsell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs\nalso sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the\ncapability to subscribe to Microsoft 365 Consumer.\n\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them\nis managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering\none or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with\nmany regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume\nPC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the\nMicrosoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements\nand Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web\nagencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (\"Enterprise Agreement\nSoftware Advisors\" or \"ESA\"). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate\ncustomers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many\nof these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search,\nand gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are\ndesigned to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\"LSP\"),\ndistributors, value-added resellers (\"VAR\"), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"15\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1\n\norganizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs,\nand VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate\nas resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program\nfor reselling cloud services.\n\nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized\nreplicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We\ndistribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support\npersonnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners\nproviding vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations of varying sizes that want to purchase our cloud services and on-premise software.\nWe license these organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses\nof products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. These volume licensing\nprograms have varying programmatic requirements and benefits to best meet the needs of our customers.\n\nSoftware Assurance (\"SA\") conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the\ncontract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use\nsoftware efficiently. SA is required to be purchased with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional\npurchase with others.\n\n\n### Volume Licensing Programs\n\n\n#### Enterprise Agreement\n\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility\nto buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium\nor large organizations that want to license Microsoft products and services organization-wide over a three-year period.\nOrganizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses (covered with $\\mathrm { S A }$ and/or subscribe to cloud services.\n\n\n#### Microsoft Customer Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Customer Agreements are simplified purchase agreements presented, accepted, and stored through a digital\nexperience. Microsoft Customer Agreements are non-expiring agreements that are designed to support all customers\nover time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft.\n\n\n#### Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to,\nactivate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. These agreements allow\ncustomers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.\n\n\n#### Microsoft Products and Services Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license\ncloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-\nexpiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers\nthat purchase perpetual licenses.\n\n\n#### Open Value\n\nOpen Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements\nare designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over\na three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or\nsubscribe to licenses and SA is included.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"16\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n#### Select Plus\n\nA Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at\nany affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual\nlicenses and SA is optional.\n\n\n#### Partner Programs\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need\nin combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud\nreseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision,\nmanage, and support their customer subscriptions.\n\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software\nvendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide hosted applications and software services\nto their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on units\nlicensed.\n\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other\napplications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.\n\n\n## CUSTOMERS\n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector\ninstitutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly\nupon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those\nthat may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user\nprivacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. How these laws and\nregulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. To comply with the accelerating global regulatory obligations, we established a\nregulatory governance framework and to create a repeatable system-focused approach to regulatory governance with\nan initial focus on four domains: Responsible Al, Privacy, Digital Safety, and Cybersecurity. The framework is designed\nto help us maintain customer trust and confidence in our products, remain in compliance with regulators around the\nglobe, and effectively scale our capability to address the growing number of complex regulations. Through the\nframework, our legal and regulatory subject matter experts ingest regulations, develop standards and implementation\nguidance, and, when appropriate, work with our engineers to develop and implement products to monitor compliance.\nOur business teams, with legal support, manage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and\ncommercial reporting, and our internal audit teams conduct reviews of our programs and processes. While we intended\nto create a unified approach to regulatory compliance, some of the programs and processes established pursuant to\nthe framework are tailored to meet specific regulatory obligations, such as with the creation of independent compliance\nfunctions required by the European Union (\"EU\") Digital Markets Act and the EU Digital Services Act, which oversee,\nmonitor, and assess the company's compliance with these acts.\n\nFor a description of the risks we face related to regulatory matters, refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form\n10-K).\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"17\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1\n\n\n## INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nOur executive officers as of July 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Position with the Company</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Satya Nadella</td>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Judson B.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below,\nthat could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading\nprice of our common stock.\n\n\n### STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\n\n\n#### We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n\n##### Competition in the technology sector\n\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources\nto small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical,\nmarketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which\nwe compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions\nof new products and services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal\nto businesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n\n\n#### Competition among platform-based ecosystems\n\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many\nparticipants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,\napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the\nmarketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that\nprovide competing platforms.\n\n· A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements\nof a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets,\nsmartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model\nalso earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications\nand content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and\nperformance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware\nand software products and services. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model may\nincrease our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n\n· We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant\ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones\nand tablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device\nand its platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed\nby PCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices\nmay make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing\nwith operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular\nproducts or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition,\nsome of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") partners,\nwhich may affect their commitment to our platform.\n\n· Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases.\nThe variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing\ndecisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching\nplatforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and\nensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete\nwith competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\noperating margins. Competitors' rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict\nour ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business\nmodel objectives.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which\nmay adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\n## Business model competition\n\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n\n· A material part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing\ndevices. Our competitors continue to develop and deploy cloud-based services for consumers and business\ncustomers, and pricing and delivery models are evolving. We and our competitors are devoting significant\nresources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.\n\n. We are investing in artificial intelligence (\"Al\") across the entire company and infusing generative Al\ncapabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect Al technology and services to be a\nhighly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will\nbear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms,\nand infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be\nresponsive to technological change, new and potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.\n\n· Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business\nmodel, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software\nrevenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in\nresearch and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products.\nMany of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n\n· Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by\nselling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these\ncompetitors provide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n\n. Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no\ncost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products\nand services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source\nproducts. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased\noperating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which may adversely affect\nour financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant\ncosts to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing and Al services. These costs will reduce the\noperating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and Al services depends on our execution in several areas,\nincluding:\n\n. Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and Al experiences and products that generate\nincreasing traffic and market share.\n\n· Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and Al services on the growing\narray of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices.\n\n. Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n\n· Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our\ncustomers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n\n· Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and\necosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we\nare not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or\nif we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the\ninfrastructure and development investments described above. This may adversely affect our operations, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n\nOur AI systems offer users powerful tools and capabilities. However, there may be instances where these systems are\nused in ways that are unintended or inappropriate. In addition, some users may also engage in fraudulent or abusive\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\nactivities through our cloud-based services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or terms of service\nviolations including cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. While are committed to detecting and controlling\nsuch misuse of our cloud-based and Al services, our efforts may not be effective, and we may incur reputational\ndamage or experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations.\n\n\n# RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\n\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will\ncontinue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and\ntechnologies. In addition, we are focused on developing new Al platform services and incorporating Al into existing\nproducts and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity,\ncommunication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are\nspeculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovation, developer support, and effective\ndistribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality\nor other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably\naffecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel\ninvestments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable or may not achieve operating\nmargins as high as we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features that drive post-\nsale monetization opportunities. Our data-handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under\nscrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or\nproduct experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption. Developing new technologies is complex.\nIt can require long development and testing periods. We could experience significant delays in new releases or\nsignificant problems in creating new products or services. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to\ncontinue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business\nstrategy. For example, in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and in October\n2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (\"Activision Blizzard\"). In January 2023 we announced\nthe third phase of our OpenAl strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve\nsignificant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory\nreturn on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty\nintegrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our\nother businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately\nanticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the\narrangement. We also have limited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which\nmay impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend\nin part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones,\nas well as the acquired companies' ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance,\nprivacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and\narrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we\nexpected. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed. For example, the\nFederal Trade Commission continues to challenge our Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or\nunwind the transaction. These events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\n\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant\ncharge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit\nfrom those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable\nintangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances,\nindicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a\ndecline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in\nindustry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record,\na significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill\nor amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\n\n\n# CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\n\n## Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\n\n### Security of our information technology\n\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations,\nincluding state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our\ncustomers and our IT, and we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have gained unauthorized\naccess to our IT systems and data, including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide variety of methods,\nwhich include developing and deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential vulnerabilities or\nintentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and services or\ngain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users,\npartners, or customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to\nour data or our users' or customers' data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For\nexample, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19,\n2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used\na password spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts.\nThe threat actor used and may continue to use information it obtained to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access\nto some of our source code repositories and internal systems, and the threat actor may utilize this information to\notherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm\nto our reputation and customer relationships. Additionally, we may discover additional impacts of this or other incidents\nas part of our ongoing examination of this incident. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious\nactivities for extended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks\nagainst us, our customers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or\narmed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Cyber incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate,\ncould adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation, or expose us\nto legal or regulatory risk.\n\nInadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or\nthose of the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our IT systems and data,\nincluding customer systems and data, in the future. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove\nemployee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our\nor our users' security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain\nto introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of\ndetecting and successfully defending against them. Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI\nand machine learning. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which\nmay allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine the best way to\ninvestigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful,\nand we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access\nto other networks and systems after establishing a foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can\nhave cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, as well as those\nof our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full\nimpact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full,\nand reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our\nfacilities, network, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability\nto provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,\ncompromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other\nassets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate\nthe impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident\ncould result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our services.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"23\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\nOur internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We\nembrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such\nas social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal\nsystems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not\nkeep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or the emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions\nworldwide.\n\n\n## Security of our products, services, devices, and customers' data\n\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers' decisions to purchase or use our products or\nservices across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like\nus, whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to or attacks on our own IT\ninfrastructure, such as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our customers and\nmay do so in the future. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including\nhardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of\ntheir data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services,\nincluding many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises\nor cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero-day\") vulnerabilities, such as the attack in\nearly calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any\nproduct can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates,\nor if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise\ncustomers' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace\ndigital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our\nusers' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security\npractices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious\nsoftware impacting a customer's use of our products or services. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software\nthat may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we increasingly incorporate open source software into our\nproducts. Additionally, features that rely on generative Al may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from\nadversaries as we add new generative Al features to our services while continuously developing our understanding of\nsecurity risks and protection methods in the new field of generative AI.\n\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may\ninclude systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and\nproducts, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result,\nwe may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a\nmore secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase\nour customers' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our\ntechnology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-\nof-the-art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical\nsophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these\nsettings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability\nto review and reset these defaults.\n\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We\nare committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have\nactionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and\nsupport on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks\nfor all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves\non-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers'\ncomputing environments.\n\nAny of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\n\n## Development and deployment of defensive measures\n\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers' systems,\nwe must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability\nfeatures, escalate and improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own\nproducts as well as those provided by others in a timely manner, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure\ncustomers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that\nprotects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus\nsoftware, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing\nSO.\n\nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail\nto do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues,\nor reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products\nor subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting\ntheir existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers\nin certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized\nexpectations and requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. Customers and third parties\ngranted access to their systems may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no\nlonger support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security\npractices Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities\nmay lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure\nto liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial\nobjectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\n\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem\nof third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting\nit, we may experience adverse impacts to our results of operations, reputation, or competitive position.\n\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow\nthe number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of\npersonal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence\nof an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security\ncontrols across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our\ntraining of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper\ndisclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to\ncontinuously improve security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that\ncould lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access\nto our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our\nreputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data,\nresulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and\nusers to store and process personal data on-premises or in a cloud-based environment we host. Government\nauthorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S.\nand elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government\nauthority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection,\nuse, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services\nand could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional\nsecurity measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine\nwhere and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions,\nmay increase costs or hinder sales of our products and services.\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other\nMicrosoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or\ntechnical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use\nof this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from\nscraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\n\n## Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.\n\n\n### Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\n\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties,\nour reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity\nmay come from users impersonating other people or organizations, including through the use of AI technologies,\ndissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or\nthe use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends.\nPreventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology\nand these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n\n\n### Other digital safety abuses\n\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or\nillegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale,\nthe limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such\ncontent may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to\nmake platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect\nthis to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage\nif we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n\nOur products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services\ninteract with them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks. Our products and services may contain\ndefects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. For\nexample, an Internet of Things solution may have multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and\nfirmware, several of which we may not develop or control, and may have limited ability to be updated or patched.\nFurther, customers control our products and services, including our Al products, within their environments, and may\ndeploy them in high-risk scenarios or utilize them inappropriately. As a result, our products and services may\nincreasingly affect personal health and safety. Our products may also collect large amounts of data in manners which\nmay not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. Our customers also operate complex IT systems with third-party\nhardware and software from multiple vendors whose products or personnel may take or fail to take actions which\nimpact the reliability or security of our products and services. If our products and services do not work as intended, are\nutilized in methods not intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims\nor enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation, or adversely affect\nour results of operations.\n\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are\nbuilding Al into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making Al available for our\ncustomers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic\npartner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which Al operating in\ndevices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with\nmany innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI\nalgorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased\ninformation. Content generated by Al systems may be offensive, illegal, inaccurate, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective\nor inadequate Al development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the\nacceptance of Al solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not\nworking as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. Our implementation of AI systems could result\nin legal liability, regulatory action, brand, reputational, or competitive harm, or other adverse impacts. These risks may\narise from current copyright infringement and other claims related to Al training and output, new and proposed\nlegislation and regulations, such as the European Union's (\"EU\") Al Act and the U.S.'s Al Executive Order, and new\napplications of data protection, privacy, consumer protection, intellectual property, and other laws. Some Al scenarios\npresent ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer Al solutions that have unintended\nconsequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, are contrary to our responsible AI\npolicies and practices, or are otherwise controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment,\nor other social, economic, or political issues, our reputation, competitive position, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"26\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an\nadequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our\nproducts and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease\ndatacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our\nwebsites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable\nenergy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. The cost or\navailability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean\nenergy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue\nto increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing\nservices, including through the incorporation of Al features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business\nof providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining,\nsecuring, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for\ndatacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet\nconnectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and\nregulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent\nloss of customer data, outages, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power or water supply, or\ninadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience,\nresulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our\nreputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely affect\nour business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter\ncomponents. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our\nserver capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for Al services.\nCapacity available to us may be affected as competitors use some of the same suppliers and materials for hardware\ncomponents. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint,\nindustry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely\nreplacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and\ncontinued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price\nreductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Datacenter servers, Xbox consoles,\nSurface devices, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions\nin the supply chain, resulting in shortages which may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\n\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated\nsoftware we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers\nincreasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are\ninterdependent on one another. Our products and services may be impacted by interaction with third-party products\nand services. Our customers may also utilize their own or third-party products and services whose reliability is\ndependent on interaction with our products and services. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact\nof quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales,\ndamage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal\nliability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although our license\nagreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these\nprovisions will withstand legal challenge.\n\nOur hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly\ncomplex. Failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in\nrecalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n\n### LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\n\nGovernment enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how we design and\nmarket our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws.\nGovernments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to intervene in\ndigital markets, and this includes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"27\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\nalso allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities\nhave previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\n\nFor example, the European Commission (\"the Commission\") has designated Windows and Linkedln as core platform\nservices subject to obligations under the EU Digital Markets Act, which prohibits certain self-preferencing behaviors\nand places limitations on certain data use among other obligations. The Commission also continues to closely\nscrutinize the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in\nthese products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship\nproduct releases such as Microsoft 365 and Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition\nlaws.\n\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time, our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices\nfor our platforms. As a result, we increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that\nwe fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign\ngovernments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws\nthat exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n\nCompetition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with new market regulations may result in fines or\nhinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of\nour products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions or obligations under market\nregulation schemes could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions,\nor steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products\nfrom or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to\nmonetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that\nmay reduce their value, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal\npenalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws and\nregulations (\"Anti-Corruption Laws\") prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the\naccounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls.\nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from\nemployees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws.\nPeriodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and\nforeign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU\nWhistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which presents compliance challenges as it is implemented in different forms\nby EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from\ncolluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources\nto our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls\ndesigned to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents\nmay violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant\nfines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our\nbusiness, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside\nthe U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most\nbusiness with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products\nand services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from\nintegrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review\nof transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign\nadversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nPeriods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and\nrapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and\n(2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with\nsanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary\nfines, loss of revenue, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"28\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or\nresult in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and\ncloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal\nrequirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example,\nwhile the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\"DPF\") has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers\nof personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which\ncould cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have\nand may again block the use of certain U.S .- based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and\nother markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"),\nwhich applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services\noffered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently,\nthe EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the\nDigital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and\nservices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve\nsubstantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced\ndemand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet\ntheir obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less\nattractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If\nwe fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by\ncustomers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private\nlawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers.\nThe highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology\ncompanies, and European data protection authorities have taken action to block or remove services from their markets.\nJurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting\nor expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal\ndata.\n\nOur investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers,\nincluding Al services, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of\nquality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the\nexpected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft\npractices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements,\nincluding data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our\ncustomer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result\nin increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms.\nCompliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some\njurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders\nto stop the alleged noncompliant activity, negative publicity, and diversion of management time and effort.\n\nExisting and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those\nthat may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user\nprivacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, digital accessibility, advertising, and online content. Laws in\nseveral jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code,\nincreasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will\nresult in these offerings being subject to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other\nobligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data\nand other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users\nvia technology such as cookies. In addition, laws requiring us to retrieve and produce customer data in response to\ncompulsory legal demands from law enforcement and governmental authorities are expanding and the requests we\nare experiencing are increasing in volume and complexity. New environmental, social, and governance laws and\nregulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action\nrelating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and\nservices. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of Al and content moderation, which could increase\ncosts or restrict opportunity. For example, the EU's Al Act may increase costs or impact the provision or operation of\nour AI models and services in the European market.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"29\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\nHow these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes\nmay be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments' approach to enforcement, and our\nproducts and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations\nmay involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results\nof operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties, criminal sanctions, or orders we cease the\nalleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors,\ncustomers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or\nlegal requirements, we could face regulatory or legal actions, and our business, operations, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of\nclaims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major\nnew product releases, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices,\nand regulation. As we continue to expand our business and offerings, we may experience new and novel legal claims.\nAdverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that\ncould adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent\nuncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact to our\nfinancial condition and results of operations could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome\nbecomes probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue\nfrom government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private\ncommercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these\ncontracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and\npenalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to\nterminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic\nfunding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products\nand services. These events could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\n\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business,\nthere are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize\nadditional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and\nadministrative practices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions. In recent\nyears, multiple domestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large\nmultinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to\nadvance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.\n\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for\nincome taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken.\nIn addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax\ndisputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit for prior tax years and\nhave received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\"NOPAs\") from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The primary\nissues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax\npayment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits\nor litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our\nresults of operations in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\n\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in\ncountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about\ncertain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition,\nchanges in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other global\nfundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing\njurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations, which exposes us to\nincreased costs and legal and reputational risks. Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental, social,\nand governance matters are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may include\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\nspecific, target-driven frameworks and disclosure requirements. In addition, we have established and publicly\nannounced goals and commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and protect more land\nthan we use. Any failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and commitments or to satisfy\nvarious sustainability reporting standards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce, or at all, could\nresult in claims and lawsuits, regulatory actions, or damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely affect our\nbusiness, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\n# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\n\nWe face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our\nbusiness and operating results being harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed\ncopying and use of our software, source code, and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the\nabsence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.\n\nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Our increasing\nengagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain\nsituations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nSource code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our\nbusiness. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become\neasier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our results\nof operations. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also could increase\nthe security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\n\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe\ntheir intellectual property rights, including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from Al training and\noutput. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on terms that\nare less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to\nsatisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or\ninjunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing\ntechnologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual\nproperty rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue\nto do so, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n\n# GENERAL RISKS\n\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and results of operations may be harmed. Our\nreputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our\nability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation\nor brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and\nsustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers,\ngovernment entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering\ndecisions, public policy positions, or corporate philanthropic initiatives. Damage to our reputation or our brands may\noccur from, among other things:\n\n· The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners\ndo not like.\n\n· Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and\ndeployment of AI.\n\n· Data security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible Al failures, compliance failures, or actions of\npartners or individual employees.\n\nSocial media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation\nare damaged, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified\nemployees.\n\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including\ninflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"31\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\naffect our results of operations. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or\nbusiness spending for those products declines, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our\nsoftware have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such\nas the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they\nhave purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to\ngeneral credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that\naffect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If\nglobal financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to\nan actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could\ndetermine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems,\noperations, or supply chain because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or\nother catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical\nfunctions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain\nother essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the\nSilicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the\ndestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such\nas power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or adversely affect our results of\noperations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of\nour systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential negative\nconsequences of prolonged service outages.\n\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose economic\nand other risks, which may negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers, increase our operating\ncosts, or otherwise disrupt our operations in markets both directly and indirectly impacted by such events. These\nconditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers\n\nregulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to\nnational, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact\nour ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively\naffect our results of operations.\n\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our business,\noperations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business\ngoing forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and\nindividuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of\nrecession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in\nthese Risk Factors.\n\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear.\nEnvironmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may\naffect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business.\nChanges in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to\ndevelop software and provide cloud-based services.\n\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world\nand a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational,\neconomic, and geopolitical risks. Global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and\nrecession, as well as political and military disputes, may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our\ninternational growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including\ndeterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and\nmanaging foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"32\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\nenvironment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments.\nChanges to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in\nhigher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other\ndevelopments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed\nor emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain\nregions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of\noperations.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on\nsuccessfully attracting, training, and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and\nskill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our\nbrand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are\nimportant to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by\nrestrictive domestic immigration laws. Restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent, including as a result\nof changes to U.S. immigration policies or laws, may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development\nefforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders,\nour ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession\nplanning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth\ntransitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws\nare interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how\nwe meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some\nemployees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been\na general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee\npopulations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions\nand to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"33\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1B, 1C\" -->\n\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and\nExchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2024 that remain\nunresolved.\n\n\n## ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\n\n### RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\n\nMicrosoft plays a central role in the world's digital ecosystem. We have made it the top corporate priority to protect the\ncomputing environment used by our customers and employees and to support the resiliency of our cloud infrastructure\nand services, products, devices, and our internal corporate resources from determined adversaries. In response to the\nevolving cybersecurity threat landscape, we launched the Secure Future Initiative (\"SFI\") in November 2023 and\nexpanded the scope of SFI in May 2024. The SFI focuses our business strategy and efforts on continual improvement\nin cybersecurity protection, and is aligned around three security principles:\n\n· Secure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service.\n\n· Secure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and\nare not optional.\n\n· Secure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be improved to meet current and\nfuture threats.\n\nWe operate a cybersecurity program and governance framework designed to protect our computing environments\nagainst cybersecurity threats, and we have controls, policies, and procedures to identify, manage, and mitigate\ncybersecurity threats. Annually, we assess our cybersecurity program's alignment with the National Institute of\nStandards & Technology's Cyber Security Framework (\"NIST\") and other applicable industry standards. We also\nundertake integrated planning and preparedness activities to support business continuity and operational resiliency.\nWe assess our program's effectiveness through various exercises, including tabletop simulations and production\nenvironment tests, penetration and vulnerability tests, red team exercises, and other related activities. We conduct\nmandatory cybersecurity training, provide employees with tools to report suspected incidents and assess their own\nsecurity posture, and conduct real-time simulated employee education exercises, such as phishing email campaigns\ndesigned to emulate real-world attacks. We also engage in robust cybersecurity assessments and remediation efforts\nfor acquired companies.\n\nOur computing environments, products, and services are reviewed by our internal audit teams as well as independent\nthird-party assessors. We are committed to managing the most significant risks to our strategies and ambitions,\nincluding cybersecurity risks. The Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") organization supports management in this\ncommitment by facilitating the semiannual risk assessment, which documents the priority and status of these risks and\naligns them with our strategic mitigation efforts. ERM is structured using a framework based on the Committee of\nSponsoring Organization (\"COSO\") guidance on Enterprise Risk Management Integrating Strategy with Performance\nand it also aligns with the International Organization for Standardization 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.\n\nWe continuously monitor our computing environments, products, and services for vulnerabilities and signs of\ncompromise, and we utilize our own security products to combat cybersecurity threats. We integrate security into our\ncomputing environments, products, and services through our Security Development Lifecycle (\"SDL\"). Our SDL\nintroduces security and privacy considerations throughout all phases of our development process and through the\nadoption of zero-trust end-to-end architecture. We utilize machine learning and AI-powered security tools to gain\ninsights from over 78 trillion signals per day and over 135 million managed devices. We track over 300 unique threat\nactors, including 160 nation-state actors and 50 ransomware groups. To support our efforts, we operate a Cyber\nDefense Operations Center connected to over 10,000 security and threat intelligence experts, including engineers,\nresearchers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, threat hunters, geopolitical analysts, investigators, and frontline\nresponders across the globe.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"34\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1C\n\nWhen appropriate, we utilize external service providers to assess, test, or otherwise assist our program. We also\nleverage third parties by working with external researchers, operating bug bounty programs, and managing coordinated\nvulnerability disclosure programs with security organizations. We maintain a systematic approach to assessing and\ncontrolling the cybersecurity risks presented by third-party service providers. We require third-party service providers\nto manage their cybersecurity risks in defined ways, undergo cybersecurity reviews, notify us of cyber events, and\nsatisfy additional contractual requirements.\n\nWe seek to improve the entire cybersecurity ecosystem through multistakeholder diplomacy to set and uphold\nexpectations for state behavior, advancement of government policy that strengthens cybersecurity and resiliency,\ndisruption and deterrence of cybercrime, protection of national security interests, and disruption of digital threats to\ndemocracies. We also establish processes and innovate solutions for us and our customers to address the growing\nnumber and complexity of cybersecurity regulations.\n\nWhen we experience a cybersecurity incident, we utilize our well-established incident response plans that operate both\nacross the company and at the product and services level. Incidents are first triaged for severity, and then more deeply\nassessed to establish a plan of record and activate internal and external notification, disclosure, and communication\nplans, as applicable. Engineering and development resources are mobilized to resolve or remediate the incident. After\nthe incident is resolved, a comprehensive post-incident review process is conducted.\n\nWe describe the risks from cybersecurity threats, including previous cybersecurity incidents, in section \"Risk Factors\"\n(Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). As of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity\nthreats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our results of operations or\nfinancial condition. However, the cybersecurity threat environment is increasingly challenging, and we, along with the\nentire digital ecosystem, are under constant and increasing threat. As discussed above, our business strategy is tied\nto the SFI and we are committed to continuously monitoring cybersecurity threats, enhancing the security of our\nproducts, investing in our cybersecurity infrastructure, and collaborating with peers, customers, service providers,\nregulators, and governments to advance our and the entire digital ecosystem's cybersecurity defenses and resiliency.\n\n\n# GOVERNANCE\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity reviews by the Board are scheduled to occur at least\nquarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. Presentations to the Board of Directors are\nmade by senior management, including our Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), our EVP of Microsoft Security,\nand the head of our Customer Security and Trust organization. The presentations address topics such as cybersecurity\nthreats, incidents, top risks and related remediation efforts, results from internal and third-party assessments, progress\ntowards risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, regulatory developments, and digital\ndiplomacy efforts. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of\nsignificant issues. Cybersecurity issues are also considered during separate Board meeting discussions regarding\nimportant matters like ERM, audit issues, operational budgeting, business continuity planning, mergers and\nacquisitions, brand management, and other relevant matters.\n\nOur CISO leads the strategy, engineering, and operations of cybersecurity across the company, and reports to the\nEVP of Microsoft Security. Our CISO has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and\ncybersecurity risk. Before joining Microsoft, our CISO served in a prior Chief Technology Officer role as well as in senior\nleadership, engineering, and operational roles within multiple organizations. In addition to the Board's oversight of\ncybersecurity risk, to support the CISO, we have established a Cybersecurity Governance Council (\"CGC\") charged\nwith overseeing initiatives that safeguard Microsoft's infrastructure. The CGC is comprised of an executive-level team\nof Deputy CISOs with cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relevant to their roles. The CGC responsibilities include\napproving our enterprise security risk assessment process and results, determining the appropriate cybersecurity risk\nlevel and mitigations, reviewing the NIST CSF alignment, and supporting compliance with cybersecurity regulations.\nOur cybersecurity efforts are supported directly by Microsoft's security and threat intelligence experts and our\nemployees across the company, all of whom receive cybersecurity awareness training and education and are expected\nto support our efforts.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"35\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 2, 3, 4\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is\nintended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A\nis provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the\nresults of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. For a discussion\nof the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n### OVERVIEW\n\nMicrosoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (\"Al\") available\nbroadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to\nachieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by Al, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving\nneeds of our customers.\n\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and\nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global\naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees;\nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing,\nmarketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\n\nHighlights from fiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023 included:\n\n· Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 23% to $137.4 billion.\n\n· Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% driven by Office 365 Commercial\ngrowth of 16%.\n\n· Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 4% and Microsoft 365 Consumer\nsubscribers grew to 82.5 million.\n\n· LinkedIn revenue increased 9%.\n\n· Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\n\n· Server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% driven by Azure and other cloud services\ngrowth of 30%.\n\n· Windows revenue increased 8% with Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\"Windows OEM\")\nrevenue growth of 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth of 11%.\n\n· Devices revenue decreased 15%.\n\n· Xbox content and services revenue increased 50% driven by 44 points of net impact from the Activision\nBlizzard Inc. (\"Activision Blizzard\") acquisition. The net impact reflects the change of Activision Blizzard\ncontent from third-party to first-party.\n\n. Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 12%.\n\nOn October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion,\nconsisting primarily of cash. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial\nstatements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More Personal Computing\nsegment. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n#### Industry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each\nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform\nthe industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"38\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\nresearch and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users,\nindustry trends, and competitive forces.\n\n\n#### Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are\ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in\nthe cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for\nour software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs\nand may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter\nlocations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing\ndemand for Al services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy,\nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices\nare primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability\nto use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However,\nsome of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions\nat these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university\nand industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working\nenvironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products\nand businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue\nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates\nmay significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did\nnot have a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n\n#### Seasonality\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue\nis driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\n\n\n#### Change in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments\nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from\nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n\n#### Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent\nCloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent\nwith our internal management reporting.\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic\nData of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n\n#### Metrics\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"39\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation\nof resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency\ninto performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other\nbusiness metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services.

The decrease in our effective\ntax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-\n55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued\nin the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024\nfor Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of\nfinal foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in\nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional\noperations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a\nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2024, our\nU.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In\nfiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes\nwas $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") published its model rules \"Tax Challenges\nArising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)\" which established\na global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries have implemented or\nare in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025.\nWhile we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor\nthe impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.\n\n\n###### Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on\nSeptember 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\"NOPAs\") from the IRS. The primary issues in the\nNOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9\nbillion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are\nadequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's\nadministrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues\nin the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or\ndecrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\nsubject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The\nresolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n##### NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year\nnon-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses,\nimpairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance\nand help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"46\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\nmeasures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)</th>\n<th>2024</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>Percentage Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross margin</td>\n<td>$ 171,008</td>\n<td>$ 146,052</td>\n<td>17%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>152</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 171,008</td>\n<td>$ 146,204</td>\n<td>17%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating income</td>\n<td>$ 109,433</td>\n<td>$ 88,523</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1,171</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 109,433</td>\n<td>$ 89,694</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income</td>\n<td>$ 88,136</td>\n<td>$ 72,361</td>\n<td>$2 2$</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>946</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 88,136</td>\n<td>$ 73,307</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diluted earnings per share</td>\n<td>$ 11.80</td>\n<td>$ 9.68</td>\n<td>$2 2$</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0.13</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 11.80</td>\n<td>$ 9.81</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\\*\nNot meaningful.\n\n\n### LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital\nmarkets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing\nactivities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax\nrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n#### Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $75.5 billion and $111.3 billion as of June 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Equity and other investments were $14.6 billion and $9.9 billion as of June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They\nconsist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and\nindividual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign\ncurrency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and\ncredit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns\nthat correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that\nthe short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n\n\n#### Valuation\n\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine\nthe fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S.\ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities\nor inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies\nto our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign\ngovernment bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\n3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured\nat fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these\nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without\napplying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is\nnot priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the\ninvestment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker\nprices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-\npriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate\nfor these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values\nare recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period\nfluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash\nreceived from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily\ndue to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of\ndebt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased\n$74.3 billion to $97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions\nof companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in\nadditions to property and equipment.\n\n\n## Debt Proceeds\n\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The\nproceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other\nthings, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of\nexisting debt. Refer to Note 11 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\n## Unearned Revenue\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include\nSoftware Assurance (\"SA\") and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of\neach contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue\nalso includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we\ntransfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements\n(Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2024:\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Three Months Ending</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>September 30, 2024</td>\n<td>$ 22,529</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>December 31, 2024</td>\n<td>17,664</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>March 31, 2025</td>\n<td>12,076</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>June 30, 2025</td>\n<td>5,313</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thereafter</td>\n<td>2,602</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 60,184</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-\nbased products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"48\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nbeing recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years,\nwith 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As of June 30,\n2024, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $7.6 billion, of which $3.8 billion is short-term and payable in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\n\n### Share Repurchases\n\nDuring fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 32 million shares and 69 million shares of our common stock for\n$12.0 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using\ncash resources. As of June 30, 2024, $10.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to\nNote 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\n### Dividends\n\nDuring fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $22.3 billion and $20.2 billion,\nrespectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by\nour Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n### Other Planned Uses of Capital\n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of\ntechnology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will\ncontinue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and\nmarketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support\ngrowth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"49\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nleases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and\ncertain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities\nor other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\n\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nRefer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing\nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a\nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment\nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and business\ncombinations - valuation of intangible assets.\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and\nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,\ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for\ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\ncloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We\nuse a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with\nSA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell\neach of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based\non the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services\nby customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain\ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration\nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and\nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n\n### Impairment of Investment Securities\n\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair\nvalue, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the\nextent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this\njudgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"50\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nevaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the\nfinancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than\nnot that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as\nan impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market,\nindustry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment\nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a\nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine\nthe amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded\nin other income (expense), net.\n\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.\nWe evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value\nallocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below\nan operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events\nor circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance\nindicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment\nof assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value\nof each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash\nflow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is\ndependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful\nlife over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,\nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the\ndetermination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until\ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software\ncosts are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining\nwhen technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our\nsoftware products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.\nGenerally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is\nincluded in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\n\n\n## Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated\nloss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that\nan asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nIn determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an\nunfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors\ncould materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the\ncurrent year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized\nin an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is\nmore likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"51\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\ntechnical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are\nmeasured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,\nclassification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax\npositions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that\nhave been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these\nfuture tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n## Business Combinations - Valuation of Intangible Assets\n\nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the\nestimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value\ninvolves estimates and assumptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets. Critical\nestimates used in the valuation of intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected\ncash flows, useful lives, and discount rates. While management's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward-looking views\nof our business and market conditions. The judgments made in this valuation process could materially impact our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"52\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n## STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that\nare presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management's\nestimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\n\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at\nreasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial\nrecords are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These\nsystems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful\nselection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.\n\nThe Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render\nan opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the\nstandards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\n\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets\nperiodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that\neach is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.\n\nSatya Nadella\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAmy E.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n\n### RISKS\n\nWe are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use\nderivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n#### Foreign Currencies\n\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign\ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges.\nPrincipal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.\n\n\n#### Interest Rate\n\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We\nmanage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global\nfixed-income indices.\n\n\n#### Credit\n\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities.

financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").\n\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior\nperiod amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated\ncash flows statements.\n\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue\nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the\nstandalone selling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as\nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of\ngoodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible\nassets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based\ncompensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of\nuncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and\ndetermining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from\nmanagement's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments\nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from\nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\nRevenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments\nresulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n\n## Revenue\n\n\n### Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications,\nserver applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development\ntools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices,\nand related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,\nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting\nservices. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"60\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can\ninclude various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted\nfor as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected\nfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n\n#### Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made\navailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide\ncustomers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the\nsoftware. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is\nmade available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the\nupdates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally\nratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with\nSoftware Assurance (\"SA\"). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and\nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses\nare considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized\nratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises\ndistinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of\nthe software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided\non a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on\na consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization\nof such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software\nand the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud\nservices are provided.\n\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the\naction necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services\nare provided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot\nfunction without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single\nperformance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or\ndirectly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant\nproduct and service offering.\n\n\n#### Significant Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and\nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,\ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for\ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\ncloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"61\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nprovided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and\nservices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of\nthe various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services\nby customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain\ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration\nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and\nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when\nrevenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\nFor multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period.\nWe record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional\nright to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include $\\mathrm { S A }$\nand cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-\nyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for\nconsulting services to be performed in the future, Linkedln subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions,\nWindows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in\nadvance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes\nin unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within\n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have\ndetermined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our\ninvoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services,\nnot to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the\nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises\nlicenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion\nand $4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable\nbalance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently\navailable evidence.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"62\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n# Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n\n\n## (In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2024</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, beginning of period</td>\n<td>$ 716</td>\n<td>$ 710</td>\n<td>$ 798</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charged to costs and other</td>\n<td>386</td>\n<td>258</td>\n<td>157</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Write-offs</td>\n<td>(218)</td>\n<td>(252)</td>\n<td>(245)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, end of period</td>\n<td>$ 884</td>\n<td>$ 716</td>\n<td>$ 710</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>June 30,</th>\n<th>2024</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts</td>\n<td>$ 830</td>\n<td>$ 650</td>\n<td>$ 633</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other long-term assets</td>\n<td>54</td>\n<td>66</td>\n<td>77</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 884</td>\n<td>$ 716</td>\n<td>$ 710</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components\nwere $10.5 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance\nsheets.\n\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and\nservices offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, our\nfinancing receivables, net were $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing\nreceivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other\ncurrently available evidence.\n\n\n### Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of\nthose costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the\nrequirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented\nand are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the\namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization\ncompensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is\ncommensurate with annual sales activities.\n\n\n#### Cost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating\ncosts related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on\nPCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\"OEM\"), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising\nspace; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter\ncosts and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting\nservices; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are\namortized over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n\n#### Product Warranty\n\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the\nrelated revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected\nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"63\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\nspecific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we\ndo business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For\nsoftware warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the\nsoftware. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust\nthe amounts as necessary.\n\n\n#### Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and\nother headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also\ninclude third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services\ncontent. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point\nthat technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are\nreleased to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of\nrevenue over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n\n#### Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other\nheadcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,\ntrade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was\n$1.7 billion, $904 million, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n\n#### Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units\n(\"PSUs\"), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over\nthe related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common\nstock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We\nmeasure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using\nthe straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\n\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") is measured as the discount the employee is\nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n\n\n#### Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect\nof such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation\nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified\nas long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\n##### Financial Instruments\n\n\n###### Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase\nto be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments\nwith original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as\nshort-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their\nhighly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for\ncurrent operations.\n\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific\nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates\ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors,\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"64\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\ngeneral market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than\ncost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and\nqualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business\noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell\nthe security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other\nincome (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee\nconditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable\nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment\non a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment\nis less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") are evaluated to determine whether we are the\nprimary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we\nhave (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (2) the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nWe have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments\nare not consolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\n\n###### Derivatives\n\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense),\nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded\nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of\nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding\nhedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\n\n###### Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on\nthe extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair\nvalue measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\n· Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our\nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual\nfunds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n\n· Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.\nthe Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated\nby observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these\nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and\nspot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S.\nagency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and\nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap\ncontracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"65\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n· Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined\nusing model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level\n3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill\nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable\ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\n\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of\nthese investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include\nquoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\n\n###### Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory\nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our\nreview indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a\ncharge to cost of revenue.\n\n\n###### Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method\nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property\nand equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years;\ncomputer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three\nto 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\n\n\n###### Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use\n(\"ROU\") assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance\nleases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nat commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do\nnot provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest\nfor collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease\nROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include\noptions to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense\nfor lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For\ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the\noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\n\n\n###### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"66\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n###### Intangible Assets\n\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the\neconomic benefits received. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account\nevents or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\n\n\n###### Related Party Transactions\n\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection Al, Inc. (\"Inflection\"), pursuant to which we obtained a\nnon-exclusive license to Inflection's intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-\nfounder of and serves on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection,\nReprogrammed Interchange LLC (\"Reprogrammed\") and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures (\"Greylock\") each\nheld less than a 10% equity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by\nReprogrammed and Greylock by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr. Hoffman did not participate in any\nportions of the meetings of our Board of Directors or any committee thereof to review and approve the transaction with\nInflection.\n\n\n###### Recent Accounting Guidance\n\n\n####### Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new standard to improve reportable\nsegment disclosures. The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim\nconsolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\nstandard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter,\nwith early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.\n\n\n####### Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires\ndisclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective\ntax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning\nwith our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of\nthis standard on our income tax disclosures.\n\n\n######## NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock

Our objectives for holding derivatives include\nreducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our\nderivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign\ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\n\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange\nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-\ndenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging\ninstruments.\n\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign\nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\n\n\n## Interest Rate\n\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair\nvalue hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"71\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We\nmanage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-\nbased fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n\n# Equity\n\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options,\nfutures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\n\n# Credit\n\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default\nswap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.\nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n\n# Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding\nlong-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity\nof $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the\nstandard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2024, our long-term unsecured debt rating\nwas AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due\nto the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign\njurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations\ncenter in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign\nregional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our\nforeign income before tax. In fiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which\nare taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items,\nnet consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes.\nIn fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law changes primarily relates to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice\n2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for\nMicrosoft.

We assumed\nresponsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia's Devices and Services business and have been\nsubstituted for the Nokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the\nremaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that\nadverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\"FCC Guidelines\") are pre-empted by federal law.\nThe plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the\nFCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and\ntesting around emission guidelines.\n\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs' expert evidence of general causation\non the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants'\nmotion to exclude the plaintiffs' general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District\nof Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the\nCourt of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to\nthe trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence,\nportions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April\nof 2023, the court granted defendants' motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs' experts that cell phones cause brain\ncancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs' experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated\ndismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the\ncourt's order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their briefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the\nstayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court entered summary judgment in nine of the stayed\ncases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general causation outcome in the consolidated\ncases.\n\n\n##### Irish Data Protection Commission Matter\n\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (\"IDPC\") began investigating a complaint against Linkedln as to whether\nLinkedIn's targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection\nRegulation (\"GDPR\"). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided Linkedln\nwith a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC\nprovided LinkedIn with a revised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision,\nat which time Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.\n\n\n##### Other Contingencies\n\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our\nbusiness. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will\nnot have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent\nuncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $641 million. While we intend to defend these matters\nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded\namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material\nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably\nestimable.\n\n\n#### NOTE 16 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n\n##### Shares Outstanding\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"86\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\n(In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2024</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, beginning of year</td>\n<td>7,432</td>\n<td>7,464</td>\n<td>7,519</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Issued</td>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repurchased</td>\n<td>(32)</td>\n<td>(69)</td>\n<td>(95)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, end of year</td>\n<td>7,434</td>\n<td>7,432</td>\n<td>7,464</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n##### Share Repurchases\n\nOn September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion\nin share repurchases.

During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance\nbased on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal\nComputing.\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\n\n#### Productivity and Business Processes\n\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,\ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily\ncomprises:\n\n· Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial\nsubscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft\nTeams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Copilot for Microsoft 365.\n\n· Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer and Copilot Pro subscriptions, Office licensed on-\npremises, and other Office services.\n\n· Linkedln, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.\n\n· Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based\napplications across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM\napplications.\n\n\n#### Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can\npower modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n. Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows\nServer, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (\"CALs\"); and Nuance and\nGitHub.\n\n· Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance\nprofessional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"91\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n#### More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the\nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n· Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating\nsystem; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows\ncloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\n\n· Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.\n\n· Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first-party content (such as\nActivision Blizzard) and third-party content, including games and in-game content; Xbox Game Pass and\nother subscriptions; Xbox Cloud Gaming; advertising; third-party disc royalties; and other cloud services.\n\n. Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Copilot), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and\nthird-party affiliates.\n\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our\nbusiness, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from\ncertain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services,\nwhich can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a\nprofit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating\nexpenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple\nsegments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\nIn addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs\ngenerally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise\ntaxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a\ncorporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs\nbeing allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.\n\nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>(In millions)</th>\n<th colspan=\"3\"></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2024</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Productivity and Business Processes</td>\n<td>$ 77,728</td>\n<td>$ 69,274</td>\n<td>$ 63,364</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligent Cloud</td>\n<td>105,362</td>\n<td>87,907</td>\n<td>74,965</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More Personal Computing</td>\n<td>62,032</td>\n<td>54,734</td>\n<td>59,941</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 245,122</td>\n<td>$211,915</td>\n<td>$ 198,270</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating Income</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Productivity and Business Processes</td>\n<td>$ 40,540</td>\n<td>$ 34,189</td>\n<td>$ 29,690</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligent Cloud</td>\n<td>49,584</td>\n<td>37,884</td>\n<td>33,203</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More Personal Computing</td>\n<td>19,309</td>\n<td>16,450</td>\n<td>20,490</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 109,433</td>\n<td>$ 88,523</td>\n<td>$ 83,383</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"92\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nNo sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue\nfor fiscal years 2024, 2023, or 2022.

Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters\nbelow, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"94\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or\nservices. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and\nservices, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.\n\nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for certain customer\nagreements, and includes the following:\n\n· Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should\nbe accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold\nwith cloud-based services.\n\n· The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.\n\n· Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized\n(e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).\n\n· Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and\nservices that are not sold separately.\n\nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's\njudgments in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements was extensive and required a\nhigh degree of auditor judgment.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for certain customer agreements\nincluded the following:\n\n. We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the\ndetermination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.\n\n· We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements for\nreasonableness.\n\n· We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:\n\n\\- Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other\ndocuments that were part of the agreement.\n\n\\- Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.\n\n\\- Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's\napplication of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue\nrecognition conclusions.\n\n. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and\nservices that are not sold separately.\n\n.

The Company remains under IRS audit, or\nsubject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. In the current fiscal year, the Company received Notices\nof Proposed Adjustments (\"NOPAs\") for the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany transfer\npricing. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could\nhave a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management\njudgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws,\nand prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues\nthat remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of\nuncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including\ninvolvement of our tax specialists.\n\n\n### How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to\nunresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\n\n. We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the\nidentification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the\neffectiveness of the related internal controls.\n\n. We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information\nobtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n. We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain\ntax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n. For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management\nhad appropriately considered new information, including the NOPAs received in the current fiscal year, that\ncould significantly change the recognition, measurement, or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes,\nregulations, and case law, impacted management's judgments.\n\n\n## Business Combinations - Estimate for Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nOn October 13, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. The Company\naccounted for the Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquisition as a business combination and, accordingly, allocated the\npurchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as\nof the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets acquired included marketing-related intangible assets,\ntechnology-based intangible assets, and customer-related intangible assets. The excess of the purchase\nconsideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.\n\nWe identified the fair value determination of certain marketing-related and technology-based intangible assets\nfor the business combination as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required in determining\ntheir estimated fair values. Management's estimates of fair value included assumptions for revenue and expense\nforecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates. There was a high degree of auditor judgment and\nsubjectivity in applying audit procedures and evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates,\nincluding involvement of our fair value specialists.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"96\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's estimates of the fair value of certain marketing-related and\ntechnology-based intangible assets acquired included the following, among others:\n\n· We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the business combination, including internal\ncontrols over the revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates.\n\n· We assessed the knowledge, skills, abilities, and objectivity of management's valuation specialist and\nevaluated the work performed.\n\n· When assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to forecasted revenue and expenses, we\nevaluated whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering historical financial information of\nActivision Blizzard, Inc., and the Company's forecasted financial information.\n\n· With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:\n\n\\- Testing the source information underlying the discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the\ncalculations.\n\n\\- Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by\nmanagement.\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"97\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 9, 9A\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are\neffective.\n\n\n### REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for\nthe Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable\ndetail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and\nexpenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable\nassurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our\nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission. Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting did not include the internal controls of Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquired on October 13, 2023, which is\nincluded in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and represented less than 1% of our\ntotal assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2% of our total revenues\nfor the year ended June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control\nover financial reporting as of June 30, 2024; their report is included in Item 9A.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"98\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 9A\" -->\n\n\n### REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\n#### To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation\n\n\n##### Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the\n\"Company\") as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of\nthe Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded\nfrom its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Activision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired\non October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June\n30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total revenues for the year\nended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at\nActivision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n\n##### Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\n\n\n##### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 30, 2024\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"99\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II, III Item 9B, 9C, 10\" -->\n\n\n## ITEM 9B.

It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture,\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\ndated as of May 18, 2009 (the \"Base Indenture\"), between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of\nNew York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented in the case of the 2028 Notes,\nby the seventh supplemental indenture, dated as of December 6, 2013, and, as supplemented in the\ncase of the 2033 Notes, by the fifth supplemental indenture dated as of May 1, 2013 (the Base\nIndenture, as supplemented by the fifth and seventh supplemental indentures, the \"indenture\"),\nwhich are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this\nExhibit 4.1 is a part. The 2028 Notes and the 2033 Notes are each traded on The New York Stock\nExchange under the bond trading symbols of \"MSFT28\" and \"MSFT33,\" respectively.\n\nWe encourage you to read the above referenced indenture, as supplemented, for additional\ninformation.\n\n\n### General\n\nThe following is a description of certain of the specific terms and conditions of the indenture\nsupplements with respect to each of the notes.\n\nThe 2033 Notes were initially issued in an €550,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The 2028\nNotes were initially issued in an €1,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount. We are permitted to\nissue additional notes of each series of notes without the consent of the holders of that series of\nnotes, but we will not issue such additional notes unless they are fungible for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes with the relevant series of notes offered. As of July 30, 2024 no such additional notes have\nbeen issued.\n\nThe notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding.\n\nThe maturity date of the 2028 Notes is December 6, 2028. The maturity date of the 2033 Notes is\nMay 2, 2033.\n\nThe notes will be subject to legal defeasance and covenant defeasance as provided under the\n\"Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\" section set forth below.\n\nThe notes were issued in a form of one or more fully registered global securities, without coupons, in\ndenominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.\n\nThe notes are not redeemable at the option of the holder prior to maturity and will not benefit from\nany sinking fund.\n\n\n### Interest and Principal\n\nThe 2028 Notes bear interest from December 6, 2013 at a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per annum.\nThe 2033 Notes bear interest from May 2, 2013 at a fixed interest rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest\nis paid annually on December 6 for the 2028 Notes and on May 2 for the 2033 Notes, and on the\nmaturity date of each series of notes (the \"interest payment date\"). We will pay interest on the notes\nto the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the May 1 or\nDecember 5 or May 1, as applicable (in each case, whether or not a business day) immediately\npreceding the related interest payment date. Interest on the notes will be computed on the basis of\nthe actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number\nof days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the notes (or the original issue\ndate if no interest has been paid or duly provided for on the notes), to but excluding the next date on\nwhich interest is paid or duly provided for. This payment convention is referred to as Actual/Actual\n(ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.\n\nWe will pay the principal of and interest on each note to the registered holder in euro in immediately\navailable funds; provided that for the 2028 Notes, if the euro is unavailable to us due to the\nimposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer\nbeing used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro\nas their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\ninternational banking community, then all payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S.\ndollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euro will\nbe converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the\nclose of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent\nU.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second\nbusiness day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment in respect of the notes so made in\nU.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the notes or the indenture governing the\nnotes. So long as the notes are in book-entry form, we will make payments of principal and interest\nthrough the London paying agent described below.\n\nInterest payable on any interest payment date for a series of notes or the maturity date for that series\nof notes will be the amount of interest accrued from, and including, the next preceding interest\npayment date for such notes in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from\nand including the original issue date, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to\nthe notes of that series) to, but excluding, such interest payment date or maturity date, as the case\nmay be. If any interest payment date falls on a day that is not a business day, the interest payment\nwill be made on the next succeeding business day, and we will not be liable for any additional\ninterest as a result of the delay in payment. If a maturity date falls on a day that is not a business\nday, the related payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding business day,\nand no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the\nnext succeeding business day. The term \"business day\" means any day, other than a Saturday or a\nSunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or\nexecutive order to close in New York City or London and (2) on which the Trans-European\nAutomated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any\nsuccessor thereto, is open.\n\n\n### Optional Redemption\n\nAt any time prior to September 6, 2028, we will have the right at our option to redeem the 2028\nNotes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on at least 30 days' but not more than 60\ndays' prior notice mailed to the registered address of each holder of the 2028 Notes, at a redemption\nprice, calculated by us, equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to\nbe redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of\nprincipal and interest on the 2028 Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of\nredemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (Actual/Actual (ICMA)) at the\napplicable Bond Rate plus 20 basis points.\n\nAt any time prior to February 2, 2033, we will have the right at our option to redeem the notes, in\nwhole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on at least 30 days' but not more than 60 days'\nprior notice mailed to the registered address of each holder of the notes, at a redemption price equal\nto the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the\npresent values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on the notes to be\nredeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption\ndate on an annual basis (Actual/Actual (ICMA)) at the applicable Bond Rate plus 12.5 basis points.\n\nAt any time on or after September 6, 2028, we will have the right at our option to redeem the 2028\nNotes, in whole or in part, on at least 30 days' but not more than 60 days' notice, at any time at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed.\n\nAt any time on or after February 2, 2033, we will have the right at our option to redeem the 2033\nNotes, in whole or in part, on at least 30 days' but not more than 60 days' notice, at any time at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed.\n\nThe redemption price for the notes will include, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the\nprincipal amount of the notes to be redeemed to the redemption date. The redemption price paid for\nthe notes upon any such redemption will be paid in euro.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\"Bond Rate\" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the annual\nequivalent yield to maturity or interpolated maturity (on a day count basis) of the applicable\nComparable Government Issue (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the\nredemption date), assuming a price for such Comparable Government Issue (expressed as a\npercentage of its principal amount) equal to the applicable Comparable Price for such redemption\ndate.\n\n\"Comparable Government Issue\" means the euro-denominated security issued by the German\ngovernment selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated\nmaturity comparable to the remaining term of the series of notes to be redeemed that would be\nutilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new\nissues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of the notes of\nsuch series.\n\n\"Comparable Price\" means, with respect to any redemption date (1) the arithmetic average of the\nReference Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such\nReference Dealer Quotations or (2) if we obtain fewer than four such Reference Dealer Quotations,\nthe arithmetic average of all such quotations for such redemption date.\n\n\"Independent Investment Banker\" means an investment bank of international standing appointed by\nus.\n\n\"Reference Dealer\" means a broker of, or a market maker in, the Comparable Government Issue\nselected by the Independent Investment Banker.\n\n\"Reference Dealer Quotation\" means, with respect to each Reference Dealer and any redemption\ndate, the arithmetic average, as determined by us, of the bid and asked prices for the applicable\nComparable Government Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount)\nquoted in writing to us by such Reference Dealer at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the third business\nday preceding such redemption date.\n\nOn and after a redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the notes called for redemption or\nany portion of any series of the notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the\nredemption price and accrued and unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will\ndeposit with the London paying agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and (unless\nthe redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued and unpaid interest to the\nredemption date on the notes to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the notes of a series\nare to be redeemed, the notes of such series to be redeemed will be selected by the trustee by such\nmethod as the trustee will deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no notes of a principal\namount of €100,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.\n\n\n### Redemption Upon Tax Event\n\nWe may redeem the notes of any series at our option in whole, but not in part, on at least 15 days'\nbut not more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount\n(plus any accrued interest and additional amounts then payable with respect to the notes of that\nseries), if we determine that (A) as a result of any change or amendment to the laws, treaties,\nregulations or rulings of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof,\nwhich change or amendment is announced and becomes effective after the date of the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we have become obligated to pay additional amounts as described under \"-\nPayment of Additional Amounts\" on any notes of such series or (B) after the date of the applicable\nprospectus supplement, any change in the official application, enforcement or interpretation of those\nlaws, treaties, regulations or rulings, including a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction in the\nUnited States or any other action, taken by any taxing authority or a court of competent jurisdiction in\nthe United States, whether or not such action was taken or made with respect to us, results in a\nmaterial probability that we have or will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described\nunder \"-Payment of Additional Amounts\" on any notes of such series; provided that we determine, in\nour business judgment, that the obligation to pay such additional amounts cannot be avoided by use\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nof reasonable measures available to us, not including substitution of the obligor under the notes of\nsuch series.

If an event\nof default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us occurs and is\ncontinuing, the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the debt\nsecurities of that series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or\nother act on the part of the trustee or any holders.\n\nThe holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt\nsecurities of any series may rescind a declaration of acceleration and its consequences, if we have\ndeposited certain sums with the trustee and all events of default with respect to the debt securities of\nthat series, other than the non-payment of the principal or interest which have become due solely by\nsuch acceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided in the indenture.\n\nAn event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event\nof default for any other series of debt securities issued under the indenture.\n\nWe are required to furnish the trustee annually a statement by certain of our officers to the effect\nthat, to the best of their knowledge, we are not in default in the fulfillment of any of our obligations\nunder the indenture or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying\neach such default.\n\nNo holder of any debt securities of any series will have any right to institute any judicial or other\nproceeding with respect to the indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any\nother remedy unless:\n\n(1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing and such holder has given the trustee prior\nwritten notice of such continuing event of default with respect to the debt securities of that series;\n\n(2) the holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt\nsecurities of that series have requested the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event\nof default;\n\n(3) the trustee has been offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against its costs, expenses\nand liabilities in complying with such request;\n\n(4) the trustee has failed to institute proceedings 60 days after the receipt of such notice, request and\noffer of indemnity; and\n\n(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given for 60 days by the holders of a\nmajority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series.\n\nThe holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of a series will\nhave the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any\nproceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series or\nexercising any trust or power conferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. The indenture\nprovides that if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights\nand powers under the indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a\nprudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\naffairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights\nor powers under the indenture at the request of any of the holders of the debt securities of a series\nunless they will have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against\nthe costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and\nunconditional right to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on that\ndebt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the\nenforcement of payment.\n\n\n### Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n\nWe may discharge certain obligations to holders of the debt securities of a series that have not\nalready been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable\nor will become due and payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by\ndepositing with the trustee, in trust, money in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness\nincluding the principal and premium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if the debt\nsecurities have become due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the\ndebt securities of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in\nU.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests\nsolely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nThe indenture provides that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all\nobligations with respect to the debt securities of a series (except for, among other things, obligations\nto register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities, to replace temporary or mutilated,\ndestroyed, lost or stolen debt securities, to maintain an office or agency with respect to the debt\nsecurities and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (\"legal defeasance\") or (2) to be released from\nour obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the indenture, and any omission to\ncomply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the\ndebt securities of a series and clauses (4) and (7) under \"-Events of Default\" will no longer be applied\n(\"covenant defeasance\"). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be\nconditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an\namount, or U.S. government obligations, or both, applicable to the debt securities of that series\nwhich through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will\nprovide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the\ndebt securities on the scheduled due dates therefor.\n\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the debt securities of any series, the amount, or\nU.S. government obligations, or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a\nnationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the debt securities of\nthat series at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt\nsecurities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of default. However,\nwe would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration.\n\nWe have elected pursuant to Section 1301 of the indenture, to have both Section 1302 (legal\ndefeasance) and Section 1303 (covenant defeasance) of the indenture apply to the all of the notes.\n\nWith respect to the 2028 Notes, \"U.S. government obligation\" means $\\left( I \\right) \\left( x \\right)$ any security which is (i) a\ndirect obligation of the United States of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of\nthe United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person (as defined in the indenture)\ncontrolled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of\nAmerica the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by\nthe United States of America, which, in either case (I)(x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the\noption of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section\n3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any U.S. government obligation which is\nspecified in clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary\nreceipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any U.S. government\nobligation which is so specified and held; provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nnot authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary\nreceipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. government obligation or\nthe specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt or (II)(x) any\nsecurity which is (i) a direct obligation of the German Government (as defined in the indenture) or (ii)\nan obligation of a Person (as defined in the indenture) controlled or supervised by and acting as an\nagency or instrumentality of the German Government (as defined in the indenture) the payment of\nwhich is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the German Government (as defined in the\nindenture), the central bank of the German Government (as defined in the indenture) or a\ngovernmental agency of the German Government (as defined in the indenture), which, in either case\n(II)(x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates,\ndepositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations\ndescribed in clause (II)(x)(i) or (ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in\nrespect thereof.\n\nWith respect to the 2033 Notes, \"U.S. government obligation\" means (x) any security which is (i) a\ndirect obligation of the United States of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of\nthe United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person (as defined in the indenture)\ncontrolled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of\nAmerica the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by\nthe United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the\noption of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section\n3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\")) as custodian with respect to\nany U.S. government obligation which is specified in clause (x) above and held by such bank for the\naccount of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal\nof or interest on any U.S. government obligation which is so specified and held; provided that (except\nas required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount\npayable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in\nrespect of the U.S. government obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced\nby such depositary receipt.\n\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related\ndefeasance will not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the debt securities of that series to\nrecognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that\nopinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change\nin law to that effect.\n\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant\ndefeasance option.\n\nExhibit 10.5\n\n\n# MICROSOFT CORPORATION DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (Amended and Restated Effective as of April 1, 2024)\n\n\n## 1.

For example, although this Plan\nstates that upon a Participant's death, Account balances will be paid to such Participant's\nbeneficiary, the personal representative may be obligated to pay any benefits owed to a\nspouse or otherwise as a result of any applicable community property laws.\n\n6.6 Withdrawals for Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant may withdraw all or\nany portion of such Participant's Account balance for an Unforeseeable Emergency. The\namounts distributed with respect to an Unforeseeable Emergency may not exceed the\namounts necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to\npay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the\nextent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation\nby insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the\nliquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by cessation of\ndeferrals under the Plan. \"Unforeseeable Emergency\" means for this purpose a severe\nfinancial hardship to a Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the\nParticipant's spouse, or a dependent of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due\nto casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a\nresult of events beyond the control of the Participant.\n\nUnless otherwise required by IRS guidance, a Participant shall not be required to\ntake any available hardship withdrawals from the 401(k) Plan before being eligible to\nreceive a withdrawal under this section.\n\n6.7\nChanges in Time or Form of Distribution.

In no\nevent shall the total payment under this Section 6.9 exceed the aggregate amount of the\nTaxes, and the income tax withholding related to such Taxes.\n\n6.10 Settlement of Bona Fide Dispute. Subject to certain presumptions under Code\nsection 409A, if an arm's length, bona fide dispute between a Participant and the Company\narises as to the Participant's right to an amount deferred under the Plan, the payment of the\ndeferred amount as part of a settlement of such dispute shall be distributed immediately to\nthe Participant.\n\n6.11 Offset for Obligations to Company. If the Participant has any debt, obligation\nor other liability representing an amount owing to the Company (the \"Debt\"), incurred in the\nordinary course of such Participant's employment relationship, the Company shall offset the\nDebt against the Participant's Account balance. The Company shall reduce the Participant's\nAccount balance in satisfaction of the Debt at the same time and in the same amount as the\nDebt otherwise would have been due and collected from the Participant; provided however,\nin no event shall the amount of such offset in any of the Company's taxable years exceed\n$5,000.\n\n6.12 2005 Deferred Compensation.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, any such action\ntaken by the Plan Administrator shall be final and conclusive on any party. To the extent the\nPlan Administrator has been granted discretionary authority under the Plan, the Plan\nAdministrator's prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in\na like fashion thereafter. The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon\nall tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports furnished by any actuary,\naccountant, controller, counsel or other person employed or engaged by the Company with\nrespect to the Plan. The Plan Administrator may, from time to time, employ agents and\ndelegate to such agents, including other employees of the Company, such administrative\nduties as it sees fit.\n\n\n## 7.2 Claims for Benefits.\n\n(a)\nFiling a Claim.

A claim is considered\napproved only if its approval is communicated in writing to a claimant.\n\n(b)\nDenial of Claim. If a Participant's claim is denied, in whole or in\npart, a written notice will be furnished to the claimant within 90 days of the date on which\nthe claim is received by the Senior HR Officer. If special circumstances (such as for a\nhearing) require a longer period, the claimant will be notified in writing, prior to the\nexpiration of the 90-day period, of the reasons for an extension of time; provided, however,\nthat no extensions will be permitted beyond 90 days after the expiration of the initial 90-\nday period.\n\n(c)\nReasons for Denial.

Upon denial of a claim, in whole or in part, a\nclaimant or such claimant's duly authorized representative will have the right to submit a\nwritten request to the Senior HR Officer for a full and fair review of the denied claim by\nfiling a written notice of appeal with the Senior HR Officer within 60 days of the receipt by\nthe claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. A claimant or the claimant's\nauthorized representative will have, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access\nto, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant's\nclaim for benefits and may submit issues and comments in writing. The review will take\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\ninto account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the\nclaimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or\nconsidered in the initial benefit determination.\n\nIf the claimant fails to file a request for review within 60 days of the claim denial\nnotification, the claim will be deemed abandoned and the claimant precluded from\nreasserting it. If the claimant does file a request for review, the claimant's request must\ninclude a description of the issues and evidence the claimant deems relevant. Failure to\nraise issues or present evidence on review will preclude those issues or evidence from\nbeing presented in any subsequent proceeding or judicial review of the claim.\n\n(e)\nDecision Upon Review. The Senior HR Officer will provide a\nprompt written decision on review. If the claim is denied on review, the decision shall set\nforth:\n\n(i)\nthe specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination;\n\n(ii)\nspecific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the\nadverse determination is based;\n\n(iii)\na statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon\nrequest and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and\nother information relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits; and\n\n(iv)\na statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures\noffered by the Plan and the claimant's right to obtain the information about such procedures,\nas well as a statement of the claimant's right to bring an action under ERISA section 502(a).\n\nA decision will be rendered no more than 60 days after the Senior HR Officer's\nreceipt of the request for review, except that such period may be extended for an\nadditional 60 days if the Senior HR Officer determines that special circumstances (such as\nthe need for a hearing) require such extension. If an extension of time is required, written\nnotice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day\nperiod.\n\n(f)\nFinality of Determinations; Exhaustion of Remedies. To the extent\npermitted by law, decisions reached under the claims procedures set forth in this Section\nshall be final and binding on all parties. No legal action for benefits under the Plan shall be\nbrought unless and until the claimant has exhausted such claimant's remedies under this\nSection. In any such legal action, the claimant may only present evidence and theories\nwhich the claimant presented during the internal claims and appeals procedure. Any\nclaims which the claimant does not in good faith pursue through the review stage of the\nprocedure shall be treated as having been irrevocably waived. Judicial review of a\nclaimant's denied claim shall be limited to a determination of whether the denial was an\nabuse of discretion based on the evidence and theories the claimant presented during the\ninternal claims and appeals procedure. Any suit or legal action initiated by a claimant\nunder the Plan must be brought by the claimant no later than one year following a final\ndecision on appeal by the Senior HR Officer. The one-year limitation on suits for benefits\nwill apply in any forum where a claimant initiates such suit or legal action.\n\n(g)\nDisability Claims.

If any person entitled to a distribution under the Plan\nis deemed in the Plan Administrator's sole discretion to be incapacitated or otherwise\nincapable of personally receiving such payment, then, unless and until a claim for such\npayment is made by a duly appointed guardian or other legal representative of such\nperson, the Plan Administrator may provide for such payment or any part thereof to be\nmade to any other person or institution then contributing toward or providing for the care\nand maintenance of such person. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of\nsuch person and a complete discharge of any liability of the Company and the Plan with\nrespect to the payment.\n\n9.9 Legally Binding. In the event of any consolidation, merger, acquisition or\nreorganization, the obligations of the Company under this Plan shall continue and be\nbinding on the Company and its successors or assigns.

REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n### A. Do Not Trade While in Possession of Material, Nonpublic Information\n\nAs an employee of Microsoft, you may have access to financial, business and other information about Microsoft or\nother companies.

PURPOSE\n\nThis policy describes the restrictions on trading Microsoft securities that apply to Microsoft officers and other\ndesignated persons due to their regular access to material, nonpublic information about Microsoft.\n\nMembers of the Senior Leadership Team (\"SLT\") who are direct reports to the CEO (\"SLT CEO Direct Reports\") are\nsubject to an additional notification requirement described below.\n\n\n## 2. SUMMARY\n\nMicrosoft's officers and other designated employees are subject to additional trading restrictions for Microsoft\nsecurities to those set forth in the General Insider Trading Policy. In general, if you fall in this group you may only\ntrade (or gift) Microsoft securities during an open window period when your trading status is designated as Trading\nAllowed in the Insider Trading Compliance Tool.\n\n\n## 3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n### A. Application of the Policy\n\nThis policy applies to all transactions in Microsoft securities by Microsoft's officers and other employees with\nregular access to material, nonpublic information (collectively 'Insiders'). In general, you will know you are an\nInsider and subject to this policy because you will be notified. The requirements in this policy are in addition to the\nGeneral Insider Trading Policy, which applies to all employees.\n\nThis policy applies to transactions involving Microsoft securities that are beneficially owned by Insiders. 'Beneficial\nownership' is based on the Insider's direct or economic interest in the securities. Some common examples of\nrelationships that may give rise to beneficial ownership include, but are not limited to:\n\n· Microsoft shares owned by immediate family members who live with you or use your address as their\nregular address (e.g., spouse, domestic partner, minor children, college students, parents, grandparents,\ngrandchildren, siblings and in-laws).\n\n· Microsoft shares held in a trust, if the Insider is: (1) a trustee who has or shares investment control of the\ntrust securities and the Insider or a member of his or her immediate family (whether or not they live with\nyou) has an economic interest in the trust securities; (2) a beneficiary who has or shares investment\ncontrol; or (3) a person who has the power to revoke the trust.\n\n· Microsoft shares held in the name of a partnership or other entity over which the Insider has a controlling\ninfluence.\n\nInsiders are responsible for assuring that individuals or entities who may have an interest in securities that are\nbeneficially owned by the Insider ('Covered Persons') comply with this policy. Accordingly, any reference below to\n'Insiders' should be read to include 'Covered Persons.'\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n### B. Open Trading Window\n\nIf you are an Insider, you may only trade (or gift) Microsoft securities during an Open Window Period and when\nyour status is Trading Allowed in the Insider Trading Compliance Tool. However, even during an Open Window\nPeriod, you may not trade Microsoft securities if you possess material, nonpublic information about Microsoft. For\nmore information about material, nonpublic information, see the General Insider Trading Policy.\n\nAn Open Window Period means a defined period of time following Microsoft's quarterly earnings release when the\npublic has been apprised of all relevant material information about Microsoft's recent business and financial\nperformance.\n\n· Open Window Periods typically begin with the opening of trading on the second full trading day following\nMicrosoft's public release of quarterly earnings, and end at the close of trading 15 business days before the\nend of the fiscal quarter in which the earnings were released.\n\n. For example, if Microsoft made an earnings announcement on a Thursday, the Open Window Period would\nopen the following Monday, and would end at the close of the trading 15 business days before the end of\nthat fiscal quarter.\n\n. After you become subject to this Restricted Trading Window Policy, and as long as you have an active\nrestriction reason, you will receive three emails each quarter from the insider trading compliance tool. (1)\nYou will receive an email on the first business day after the public release of quarterly earnings to confirm\nthe date the trading window will open and that your trading status will be Trading Allowed. (2) You will\nreceive an email 14 calendar days before the trading window closes to let you know the date when your\ntrading status will change to No Trading Allowed. (3) You will receive an email on the date the window\ncloses to confirm that your trading status is No Trading Allowed.\n\n. Occasionally, a quarterly window may be delayed, closed early, or skipped. You will be notified if this\nhappens.\n\n· Microsoft may also institute additional 'blackout periods' during which no trades may be made, at which\ntime you should receive notification of such restriction.\n\nDo not make a trade in Microsoft securities until you receive notice that the Open Window Period has begun and\nyou have confirmed that your status in the Insider Trading Compliance Tool is Trading Allowed.\n\nYou may not disclose to any outside third party, including brokers or financial advisers, the terms of Microsoft's\nOpen Window Period, the date on which an Open Window Period has begun or ended, or that a blackout period\nhas been designated. You may disclose your status in the Insider Trading Compliance Tool as Trading Allowed or No\nTrading Allowed.\n\nIf your employment with Microsoft ends during a blackout period, you will be subject to the remainder of that\nblackout period. If your employment with Microsoft ends during an Open Window Period, you will not be subject to\nthe next blackout period. However, even if you are not subject to our blackout period after you leave Microsoft,\nyou should not trade in Microsoft securities if you are aware of material, nonpublic information. That restriction\nstays with you as long as the information you possess is material and not publicly disseminated within the meaning\nof the General Insider Trading Policy.\n\n\n### C. Application of Trading Restrictions to Particular Situations\n\n\n#### 1. Stock Awards\n\nTransactions involving Microsoft stock received by an Insider pursuant to a Stock Award may be made only during\nan Open Window Period and your status in the Insider Trading Compliance Tool is Trading Allowed.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n#### 2. Gifts\n\nGifts of Microsoft stock may be made only during an Open Window Period and your status in the Insider Trading\nCompliance Tool is Trading Allowed.\n\n\n## 3. Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nYou may purchase Microsoft stock under Microsoft's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP') at any time. However,\nyou may only sell Microsoft stock purchased pursuant to the ESPP during an Open Window Period and your status\nin the Insider Trading Compliance Tool is Trading Allowed.\n\n\n## 4. Stock Options\n\nYou may exercise stock options outside an Open Window Period only if you pay the exercise price and withholding\ntaxes in cash, and then hold the shares (known as an 'exercise and hold'). Any sale of stock as part of a broker-\nassisted cashless exercise of an option, any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay\nthe exercise price of an option, or any delivery of shares to pay the exercise price (if permissible under the\napplicable stock plan) may only be done during an Open Window Period.\n\n\n## 5. Transactions Pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Plans\n\nSales of Microsoft stock outside of the Open Window Period or during a blackout period can only be made pursuant\nto an approved written trading plan (known as a '10b5-1 Plan') that you entered into at a time that sales could be\nmade in accordance with the restrictions set forth in Section B above. To learn more, please visit the Rule 10b5-1\nTrading plans page.\n\n\n## D. Senior Leadership Team Advance Notification Requirement\n\nIn addition to the requirements above, SLT CEO Direct Reports are also required to notify CELA in advance of\ntransactions in Microsoft securities, including, but not limited to, option exercises, gifts, purchases, sales, and\npledges of Microsoft stock or debt. It does not apply to purchases made pursuant to the ESPP or sales made\npursuant to a 10b5-1 Plan, but does apply to the other scenarios described in Section C above.\n\nThe notification must include a brief description of the nature of the transaction (e.g., exercise of stock option,\npurchase, sale, gift, pledge of stock for loan, etc.), the type of Microsoft securities involved, and the proposed date\non which the Insider will enter into the transaction. Notifications should be given by sending email to\n$\\left( * * \\right.$ )@microsoft.com, or by phoning any of the following individuals (\"Contacts\"):\n☒\n\n( ** )\n☒\n\nAdvance notification can be provided by the Insider or his or her broker.\n\nAs soon as possible following notification, one of the Contacts will review the transaction and advise the Insider\nwhether he or she may proceed with the transaction. During this process, the Insider or his or her broker will be\nasked to answer some preclearance questions from a Preclearance Checklist. A copy of the Preclearance Checklist\nmay be requested from ( ** )@microsoft.com. If advance notification of a transaction is provided via e-mail, the\nInsider may wish to attach a completed Preclearance Checklist for the proposed transaction.\n\nE. Questions\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nIf you have a question about this policy, its application in relation to a proposed transaction, or reporting\nresponsibilities, you should email ( ** )@microsoft.com.\n\n\n## 4.

DOCUMENT HISTORY\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Exhibit 19.3\" -->\n\n\n# Insider Trading Compliance and Preclearance Policies for Section 16 Officers and Directors of Microsoft\n\nThis document sets forth the insider trading compliance policies that apply to transactions in Microsoft securities by\nMicrosoft officers and directors who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Insiders\").\n\nThe policies contained in this document apply to all securities \"beneficially owned\" by Insiders. Insiders are\nresponsible for assuring that other individuals or entities (\"Covered Persons\") who may have an interest in\nsecurities that are \"beneficially owned\" by an Insider comply with these policies. For more information regarding\nbeneficial ownership of securities and Covered Persons, please see Section 6 below.\n\nCovered Persons must comply with the policies below. Accordingly, any reference below to \"Insiders\" should be\nread to include Covered Persons. In addition to the policies below, all Directors must comply with the Director\nstock ownership requirements located in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and Executive Officers must comply\nwith the Stock Ownership Requirements for Microsoft Corporation Executives.\n\n\n## 1. Restrictions on Trading\n\nA. Prohibition on Trading While in Possession of Material, Nonpublic Information. Under Federal\nsecurities law and regulations, no Insider may trade in Microsoft securities while possessing material, nonpublic\ninformation concerning the Company, even if a quarterly window period described in Section 2 is open. The\nwindow period is not a safe harbor that eliminates the need for caution about whether an Insider should refrain\nfrom trading because he or she possesses material, nonpublic information about Microsoft. For more information,\nsee the General Insider Trading Policy.\n\nB. Trading Restricted to Open Window Periods. No Insider may trade in Microsoft securities outside of an\napplicable Open Window Period described below in Section 2, or during any trading blackout periods designated by\nMicrosoft, except pursuant to the terms of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan as outlined in Section 4.E below. For more\ninformation, see the Restricted Trading Window Policy.\n\nC.\nProhibition on Trading in Derivatives. Trading in derivative securities (other than derivative\nsecurities issued by Microsoft as compensation) related to Microsoft stock or debt such as options, puts, calls,\nwarrants or similar financial instruments may create the appearance among regulators and Microsoft shareholders\nthat an Insider is engaging in short-term, speculative transactions or inappropriately hedging the risk of declines in\nMicrosoft stock. For this reason, Insiders may not trade in options, puts, calls or other derivative instruments\nrelated to Microsoft stock or debt.\n\nD.\nProhibition on Pledging. No Insider may purchase Microsoft stock on margin, borrow against\nMicrosoft stock held in a margin account, or pledge Microsoft stock as collateral for a loan.\n\n\n## 2. Trading Window and Blackout Periods\n\nA. An Insider may trade in Microsoft securities only during quarterly window periods that follow each\nquarterly earnings announcement. This policy is intended to help prevent accusations of trading on material,\nnonpublic information. The theory underlying the policy is that the period of time following an earnings release is a\ntime when the public has been apprised of all relevant material information about the Company's recent business\nand financial performance. The window period generally begins on the commencement of trading on the second\nfull trading day following Microsoft's public release of quarterly earnings, and ends at the close of trading 15\nbusiness days prior to the end of the third month of the fiscal quarter in which the earnings are released (the \"Open\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nWindow Period\"). If, for example, Microsoft made an earnings announcement on Thursday, the trading window\nwould be expected to open the following Monday. There are rare situations when a quarterly window period is\ndelayed, closed early or skipped. Microsoft employees and directors who are subject to the trading window policy\nare sent email each quarter advising them of the first and last day of that quarter's Open Window Period. If an\nOpen Window Period is delayed, closed early or skipped, Insiders will be sent email alerting them to this\ndevelopment. An Insider should not trade unless he or she has received notice about the opening of the trading\nwindow.\n\nB. Insiders who have material, nonpublic information concerning Microsoft may not trade in Microsoft\nsecurities even during Open Window Periods.\n\nC. Insiders may not trade in Microsoft securities outside of an Open Window Period or during any\nblackout period that Microsoft may designate. Insiders may not disclose to any outside third party, including\nbrokers or financial advisers, the terms of the trading window policy, the date on which an Open Window Period\nhas begun or ended, or that a blackout period has been designated.\n\n\n## 3. Pre-Clearance Policies and Procedures\n\nA. Potential Section 16(b) Liability. Insiders are subject to the short-swing profit recapture rules o\nof\nSection 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Compliance with the law includes prompt reporting of an\nInsider's transactions involving Microsoft securities. The Section 16 reporting requirements also apply to\ntransactions in Microsoft securities owned by certain other individuals and entities related to an Insider, as\nexplained in greater detail in Section 5 below. Any late or delinquent filings are required to be reported in\nMicrosoft's annual proxy statement. In order to assist Insiders in complying with these reporting requirements, the\nprocedures described below have been adopted so that CELA, Corporate Legal Group may prepare and file with the\nSEC on an Insider's behalf the appropriate form reporting an Insider's transactions.\n\nThe purpose of these filings with the SEC is to give any interested party the ability to examine the filings to\ndetermine whether an Insider has violated the so-called \"short-swing profit\" rules, which prohibit a specified officer\nor director of a public company from profiting on sales and purchases of stock that occur within 6 months of each\nother. Neither lack of familiarity with the rules nor inadvertent non-compliance will excuse a violation of the short-\nswing profit rules. Generally, this law should not present Insiders at Microsoft with a problem because Microsoft\nstock purchases that an Insider makes from the Company (e.g. stock acquired on exercise of stock options and stock\npurchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan) are all exempt from short swing profit liability under SEC rules,\nand therefore any sales of stock an Insider undertakes typically would not have any non-exempt purchases of stock\nwith which they could be matched. However, an Insider may potentially have a problem if the Insider purchases\nMicrosoft shares in the open market or changes an investment election under the Microsoft 401(k) plan with\nrespect to investing in Microsoft stock. The advance notification procedures described below are intended to help\nInsiders avoid transactions that would violate Section 16(b), as well as meet the 2-day filing deadline for reporting\nmost Insider transactions in Microsoft securities. Insiders are expected to cooperate with the Company fully and\npromptly in disclosing their transactions involving Company securities.\n\nB.\nPreclearance Requirement. All Insiders are required to obtain approval from the CELA Corporate\nLegal Group before entering into any transaction involving Microsoft securities, including, but not limited to, option\nexercises, gifts, purchases, and sales, of Microsoft stock or debt. Some very limited exceptions apply as described in\nSection 4 below. The Insider or his or her broker will be asked to answer some preclearance questions in a\nPreclearance Checklist, which includes a brief description of the nature of the transaction (e.g., exercise of stock\noption, purchase, sale, gift, etc.), the type and number of Microsoft securities involved, and the proposed date on\nwhich the Insider will enter into the transaction. A copy of the Preclearance Checklist may be requested from\n** )@microsoft.com.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nPreclearance requests should be sent by email to ( ** )@microsoft.com. For questions, please call any of the\nfollowing individuals (\"Contacts\"):\n\n( ** )\n☒\n\nAs soon as possible following the preclearance request, one of the Contacts will review the transaction and advise\nthe Insider whether he or she may proceed with the transaction.\n\nC.\nConfirmation of Transaction. Immediately after the transaction is executed, the Insider or his or\nher broker must provide the details of the transaction to one or more of the Contacts, either by phone or e-mail to\n** )@microsoft.com. This information must include the following:\n\ni. type of Microsoft security involved;\n\nii. a brief description of the nature of the transaction (e.g., purchase, sale, exercise, etc.);\n\niii. number of shares involved;\n\niv. price per share;\n\nv. the total aggregate price/value; and\n\nvi. the transaction date.\n\nPlease note that this information must be provided on the date the transaction is executed (commonly referred to\nas the \"trade date\"), as opposed to on the date the transaction is settled. In nearly all cases, the trade date is the\ndate that gives rise to the Section 16 reporting obligation.\n\n\n# 4. Application of the Trading Restrictions and Preclearance Policies to Particular Situations\n\nA.\nStock Awards.\n\ni. Trading Restrictions. Transactions involving Microsoft stock received by an Insider pursuant to a\nStock Award may be made only in accordance with, and at times permitted by, the trading restrictions\ncontained in Sections 1 and 2 above.\n\nii. Preclearance and Confirmation. Insiders do not need to request preclearance or provide\nconfirmation of receipt of a Stock Award. Insiders must request preclearance and provide confirmation\nof a transaction as outlined in Section 3 above for any sales of Microsoft stock received under a Stock\nAward.\n\nB. Gifts.\n\ni. Trading Restrictions. Gifts of Microsoft stock may be made only in accordance with, and at times\npermitted by, the trading restrictions contained in Sections 1 and 2 above.\n\nii. Preclearance and Confirmation. Any gift is subject to the preclearance requirement and\nconfirmation of the transaction as outlined in Section 3 above.\n\nC.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\ni. Trading Restrictions. There is no restriction on purchases of Microsoft stock under Microsoft's\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). However, an Insider's sale of Microsoft stock purchased\npursuant to the ESPP may be made only in accordance with, and at times permitted by, the trading\nrestrictions contained in Sections 1 and 2 above.\n\nii. Preclearance and Confirmation. Insiders do not need to request preclearance or provide\nconfirmation of purchases of Microsoft stock pursuant to an election under the ESPP. However,\nInsiders must request preclearance and provide confirmation of the transaction as outlined in Section 3\nabove for any sales of Microsoft stock purchased pursuant to the ESPP.\n\n\n## D. Stock Options.\n\ni. Trading Restrictions. Stock options may be exercised outside an Open Window Period only if the\nInsider pays the exercise price and withholding taxes in cash, and then holds the shares (also known as\nan \"exercise and hold\"). Any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option,\nany other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an\noption, or any delivery of shares to pay the exercise price (if permissible under the applicable stock\nplan) may only be done in accordance with, and at times permitted by, the trading restrictions\ndescribed in Section 1 and 2 above.\n\nii. Preclearance and Confirmation. Any exercise of an employee stock option is subject to the\npreclearance requirement and confirmation of transaction process as outlined in Section 3 above.\n\n\n## E. Transactions in Microsoft Stock Pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Plans.\n\ni. Trading Restrictions. SEC Rule 10b5-1 allows trading under certain circumstances by Insiders during\nperiods when the Insider would otherwise be prohibited from trading (for example, during periods\nwhen the trading window is closed or the insider possesses material, nonpublic information). In order\nto qualify for the affirmative defense offered by this Rule, the plan must be contained in an agreement\nthat meets certain requirements, and the Insider must not exercise any discretion regarding the\ntransactions under the plan during a period when trading would otherwise be prohibited (typically\nreferred to as a \"10b5-1 Plan\"). An Insider may make sales of Microsoft stock outside of the Open\nWindow Period or during a blackout period only if such sales are made pursuant to a 10b5-1 Plan that\nconsists of an agreement with the selling broker that has been prepared by a broker-dealer or a lawyer\nrepresenting the Insider, reviewed and approved by the CELA Corporate Legal Group, and entered into\nby the Insider at a time that sales could be made in accordance with the restrictions set forth in\nSections 1 and 2 above. For additional information regarding 10b5-1 Plans and the policies associated\nwith them, please send email to ( ** )@microsoft.com.\n\nii. Preclearance and Confirmation. Insiders engaging in transactions under an approved 10b5-1 Plan\ngenerally will not have an obligation to request preclearance of such transactions. However, Insiders\n(or their brokers) must immediately confirm a transaction as provided in Section 3 above upon\nexecution of a transaction under a 10b5-1 Plan.\n\n\n## 5. Tax Services from Microsoft Independent Auditors\n\nMicrosoft's independent auditor (currently Deloitte & Touche LLP) is prohibited from providing tax services to\nindividuals in a financial reporting oversight role at Microsoft, or immediate family members of such persons, who\ndo not meet the exceptions provided by PCAOB Rule 3523.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nEmployee Insiders not in a financial reporting oversight role and directors may use Microsoft's independent auditor\nfor individual tax services, after providing advance notice to and receiving approval from CELA (via the audsvc alias).\n\nIf you are uncertain whether you a person in a financial reporting oversight role covered by this policy or are\notherwise prohibited from using Microsoft's independent auditor for tax services, you may contact\nthe( ** )@microsoft.com alias.\n\n\n## 6. Covered Persons\n\nInsiders are subject to the Section 16 reporting requirements with respect to all Microsoft securities that they\nbeneficially own. The determination of \"beneficial ownership\" is based on the Insider's direct or economic interest\nin the securities. Although not exhaustive, we have listed below the primary types of relationships that may give\nrise to beneficial ownership, thus triggering the Section 16 reporting requirement.\n\n· Microsoft shares owned by immediate family members who live with the Insider or use the Insider's\naddress as their regular address (e.g., spouse, domestic partner, minor children, college students, parents,\ngrandparents, grandchildren, siblings and in-laws).\n\n· Microsoft shares held in a trust, if the Insider is: (1) a trustee who has or shares investment control of the\ntrust securities and the Insider or a member of his or her immediate family (whether or not they share the\nsame household) has an economic interest in the trust securities; (2) a beneficiary and has or shares\ninvestment control; or (3) a person who has the power to revoke the trust.\n\n· Microsoft shares held in the name of a partnership or other entity over which the Insider has a controlling\ninfluence.\n\nInsiders may wish to consult with a Contact or send e-mail to ( ** )@microsoft.com to clarify reporting\nresponsibilities with respect to any Microsoft securities over which the Insider has voting control or in which the\nInsider has an economic interest.\n\n\n## 7. Sanctions\n\nPersons who are found to have traded on material, nonpublic information can face serious criminal and civil\npenalties. Insiders that violate the prohibition on short-swing profit transactions will be required to disgorge the\ndeemed profit from the transaction to the Company. Any late or delinquent filings are required to be reported in\nMicrosoft's annual proxy statement. In addition, the SEC has broad authority to seek sanctions from late filers;\nthese sanctions may include significant fines and other penalties. Violation of these policies may result in\ndisciplinary action up to and including immediate termination of employment. Violation of these policies also may\nbe reported in Company filings with the SEC.\n\n\n## 8. Questions\n\nAnyone with questions about these policies and procedures, or the application of them to a proposed transaction,\nmay obtain additional guidance by sending e-mail to ( ** )@microsoft.com. The ultimate responsibility for adhering\nto these policies and avoiding unlawful transactions rests with the Insider.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Exhibit 21\" -->\n\n\n# SUBSIDIARIES OF REGISTRANT\n\nThe following is a list of subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation as of June 30, 2024, omitting subsidiaries which,\nconsidered in the aggregate, would not constitute a significant subsidiary.\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Where Incorporated</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft Ireland Research</td>\n<td>Ireland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft Global Finance</td>\n<td>Ireland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited</td>\n<td>Ireland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft Online, Inc.</td>\n<td>United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LinkedIn Corporation</td>\n<td>United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company</td>\n<td>Ireland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nuance Communications, Inc.</td>\n<td>United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Activision Blizzard, Inc.</td>\n<td>United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td>\n<td>United States</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Exhibit 23.1\" -->\n\n\n# CONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in Registration Statement Nos. 333-109185, 333-118764, 333-\n52852, 333-132100, 333-161516, 333-75243, 333-185757, and 333-221833 on Form S-8 and Registration\nStatement No. 333-261590 on Form S-3 of our reports dated July 30, 2024, relating to the financial statements\nof Microsoft Corporation and the effectiveness of Microsoft Corporation's internal control over financial reporting\nappearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Microsoft Corporation for the year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 30, 2024\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Exhibit 31.1\" -->\n\n\n# CERTIFICATION\n\nI, Satya Nadella, certify that:\n\n1\\.

Please refer to Exhibit\nA attached hereto (the \"Definitions Exhibit\") for the definitions of capitalized terms used throughout this Policy.\n\n1\\. Miscalculation of Financial Performance Measure Results. In the event of a Restatement, Microsoft will\nseek to recover, reasonably promptly, all Recoverable Incentive Compensation from a Covered Officer\nduring the Applicable Period. Such recovery, in the case of a Restatement, will be made without regard to\nany individual knowledge or responsibility related to the Restatement or the Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Microsoft is required to undertake a Restatement,\nMicrosoft will not be required to recover the Recoverable Incentive Compensation if the Compensation\nCommittee determines it Impracticable to do so, after exercising a normal due process review of all the\nrelevant facts and circumstances.\n\nMicrosoft will seek to recover all Recoverable Incentive Compensation that was awarded or paid in\naccordance with the definition of \"Recoverable Incentive Compensation\" set forth on the Definitions\nExhibit. If such Recoverable Incentive Compensation was not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis,\nMicrosoft will seek to recover the amount that the Compensation Committee determines in good faith\nshould be recouped.\n\n2\\. Legal and Compliance Violations. Compliance with the law and Microsoft's Standards of Business Conduct\nand other corporate policies is a pre-condition to earning Incentive Compensation. If Microsoft in its sole\ndiscretion concludes that a Covered Officer (1) committed a significant legal or compliance violation in\nconnection with the Covered Officer's employment, including a violation of Microsoft's corporate policies\nor Microsoft's Standards of Business Conduct (each, \"Misconduct\"), or (2) was aware of or willfully blind to\nMisconduct that occurred in an area over which the Covered Officer had supervisory authority, Microsoft\nmay, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, seek recovery of all or a portion of the Recoverable\nIncentive Compensation awarded or paid to the Covered Officer for the Applicable Period in which the\nviolation occurred. In addition, Microsoft may, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, conclude\nthat any unpaid or unvested Incentive Compensation has not been earned and must be forfeited.\n\nIn the event of Misconduct, Microsoft may seek recovery of Recoverable Incentive Compensation even if\nthe Misconduct did not result in an award or payment greater than would have been awarded or paid\nabsent the Misconduct.\n\nIn the event of Misconduct, in determining whether to seek recovery and the amount, if any, by which the\npayment or award should be reduced, the Compensation Committee may consider-among other things-\nthe seriousness of the Misconduct, whether the Covered Officer was unjustly enriched, whether seeking\nthe recovery would prejudice Microsoft's interests in any way, including in a proceeding or investigation,\nand any other factors it deems relevant to the determination.\n\n3\\.\nOther Actions. The Compensation Committee may, subject to applicable law, seek recovery in the manner\nit chooses, including by seeking reimbursement from the Covered Officer of all or part of the compensation\nawarded or paid, by electing to withhold unpaid compensation, by set-off, or by rescinding or canceling\nunvested stock.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nIn the reasonable exercise of its business judgment under this Policy, the Compensation Committee may in\nits sole discretion determine whether and to what extent additional action is appropriate to address the\ncircumstances surrounding a Restatement or Misconduct to minimize the likelihood of any recurrence and\nto impose such other discipline as it deems appropriate.\n\n4\\.\nNo Indemnification or Reimbursement. Notwithstanding the terms of any other policy, program,\nagreement or arrangement, in no event will Microsoft or any of its affiliates indemnify or reimburse a\nCovered Officer for any loss under this Policy and in no event will Microsoft or any of its affiliates pay\npremiums on any insurance policy that would cover a Covered Officer's potential obligations with respect\nto Recoverable Incentive Compensation under this Policy.\n\n5\\.\nAdministration of Policy. The Compensation Committee will have full authority to administer this Policy.\nActions of the Compensation Committee pursuant to this Policy will be taken by the vote of a majority of its\nmembers. The Compensation Committee will, subject to the provisions of this Policy and Rule 10D-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and Microsoft's applicable exchange\nlisting standards, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions in connection with\nthis Policy as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by\nthe Compensation Committee will be final, binding and conclusive.\n\n6\\.\nOther Claims and Rights. The remedies under this Policy are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any legal and\nequitable claims Microsoft or any of its affiliates may have or any actions that may be imposed by law\nenforcement agencies, regulators, administrative bodies, or other authorities. Further, the exercise by the\nCompensation Committee of any rights pursuant to this Policy will not impact any other rights that\nMicrosoft or any of its affiliates may have with respect to any Covered Officer subject to this Policy.\n\n7\\.\nCondition to Eligibility for Incentive Compensation. All Incentive Compensation subject to this Policy will\nnot be earned, even if already paid, until the Policy ceases to apply to such Incentive Compensation and any\nother vesting conditions applicable to such Incentive Compensation are satisfied.\n\n8\\.\nAmendment; Termination. The Board or the Compensation Committee may amend or terminate this\nPolicy at any time.\n\n9\\.\nEffectiveness. Except as otherwise determined in writing by the Compensation Committee, this Policy will\napply to any Incentive Compensation that (a) in the case of any Restatement, is Received by Covered\nOfficers prior to, on or following the Effective Date, and (b) in the case of Misconduct, is awarded or paid to\na Covered Officer on or after the Effective Date. This Policy will survive and continue notwithstanding any\ntermination of a Covered Officer's employment with Microsoft and its affiliates.\n\n10\\.\nSuccessors. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Officers and their successors,\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives.\n\n11\\.\nGoverning Law. To the extent not preempted by U.S. federal law, this Policy will be governed by and\nconstrued in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to principles of\nconflict of laws.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# EXHIBIT A\n\n\n## DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Applicable Period\" means (a) in the case of any Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of Microsoft\nimmediately preceding the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of\nMicrosoft authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes (or reasonably should have\nconcluded) that a Restatement is required or (ii) the date a regulator, court or other legally authorized entity directs\nMicrosoft to undertake a Restatement, and (b) in the case of any Misconduct, such period as the Compensation\nCommittee or Board determines to be appropriate in light of the scope and nature of the Misconduct. The\n\"Applicable Period\" also includes any transition period (that results from a change in Microsoft's fiscal year) within\nor immediately following the three completed fiscal years identified in the preceding sentence.\n\n\"Board\" means the Board of Directors of Microsoft.\n\n\"Compensation Committee\" means Microsoft's committee of independent directors responsible for executive\ncompensation decisions, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on\nthe Board.\n\n\"Covered Officer\" means (a) in the case of any Restatement, any person who is, or was at any time, during the\nApplicable Period, an Executive Officer of Microsoft or an SLT Member, and (b) in the case of any Misconduct, any\nperson who was an Executive Officer or an SLT Member at the time of the Misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt,\na Covered Officer may include a former Executive Officer or SLT Member that left Microsoft, retired, or transitioned\nto an employee role (including after serving as an Executive Officer in an interim capacity) during the Applicable\nPeriod.\n\n\"Effective Date\" means July 1, 2023.\n\n\"Executive Officer\" means Microsoft's president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is\nno such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or\nfunction (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any\nother person (including an officer of Microsoft's parent(s) or subsidiaries) who performs similar policy-making\nfunctions for Microsoft.\n\n\"Financial Performance Measure\" means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing Microsoft's financial statements (including \"non-GAAP\" financial measures,\nsuch as those appearing in Microsoft's earnings releases or Management Discussion and Analysis), and any measure\nthat is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures\nderived wholly or in part therefrom) shall be considered Financial Performance Measures.\n\n\"Impracticable.\" The Compensation Committee may determine in good faith that recovery of Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation is \"Impracticable\" (a) in the case of any Restatement, if: (i) pursuing such recovery would violate\nhome country law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company where that law was adopted prior to\nNovember 28, 2022 and Microsoft provides an opinion of counsel to that effect acceptable to Microsoft's listing\nexchange; (ii) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the Recoverable\nIncentive Compensation and Microsoft has (A) made a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts and (B)\nprovided documentation of such attempts to recover to Microsoft's applicable listing exchange; or (iii) recovery\nwould likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to\nemployees of Microsoft, to fail to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and\n(b) in the case of any Misconduct, in its sole discretion, in light of the scope and nature of the Misconduct.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\"Incentive Compensation\" means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon\nthe attainment of a Financial Performance Measure. Incentive Compensation does not include any base salaries\n(except with respect to any salary increases earned wholly or in part based on the attainment of a Financial\nPerformance Measure performance goal); bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or\nBoard that are not paid from a \"bonus pool\" that is determined by satisfying a Financial Performance Measure\nperformance goal; bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards and/or completion of a\nspecified employment period; non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic\nmeasures or operational measures; and equity awards that vest solely based on the passage of time and/or\nattaining one or more non-Financial Performance Measures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any\nMisconduct, Incentive Compensation will include all forms of cash and equity incentive compensation, including,\nwithout limitation, cash bonuses and equity awards that are received or vest solely based on the passage of time\nand/or attaining one or more non-Financial Performance Measures.\n\n\"Received.\" Incentive Compensation is deemed \"Received\" in Microsoft's fiscal period during which the Financial\nPerformance Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of\nthe Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n\n\"Recoverable Incentive Compensation\" means (a) in the case of any Restatement, the amount of any Incentive\nCompensation (calculated on a pre-tax basis) Received by a Covered Officer during the Applicable Period that is in\nexcess of the amount that otherwise would have been Received if the calculation were based on the Restatement,\nand (b) in the case of any Misconduct, the amount of any Incentive Compensation (calculated on a pre-tax basis)\nawarded or paid to a Covered Officer during the Applicable Period that the Compensation Committee determines,\nin its sole discretion, to be appropriate in light of the scope and nature of the Misconduct. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, in the case of any Restatement, Recoverable Incentive Compensation does not include any Incentive\nCompensation Received by a person (i) before such person began service as a Covered Officer and (ii) who did not\nserve as a Covered Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation. For the\navoidance of doubt, in the case of any Restatement, Recoverable Incentive Compensation may include Incentive\nCompensation Received by a person while serving as an employee if such person previously served as a Covered\nOfficer and then transitioned to an employee role. For Incentive Compensation based on (or derived from) stock\nprice or total shareholder return where the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Restatement, the amount will be\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on\nthe stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was Received (in which case,\nMicrosoft will maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such\ndocumentation to Microsoft's applicable listing exchange).\n\n\"Restatement\" means an accounting restatement of any of Microsoft's financial statements filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, due to Microsoft's\nmaterial noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, regardless of whether\nMicrosoft or Covered Officer misconduct was the cause for such restatement. \"Restatement\" includes any required\naccounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the\npreviously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as \"Big $R ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ restatements), or that would result in a\nmaterial misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period\n(commonly referred to as \"little $r ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ restatements).\n\n\"SLT Member\" means any person who has been designated as a member of Microsoft's Senior Leadership Team,\nother than an Executive Officer.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Updated July 1, 2023\" -->\n"

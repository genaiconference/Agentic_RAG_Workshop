Initially, the insured individual seeks treatment at a non-network hospital. After treatment, the individual is discharged and pays for the treatment out of pocket. The next step is to collect all original documents, receipts, and investigation reports from the hospital. These documents, along with a filled claim form, must be submitted to the Third Party Administrator (TPA) within 21 days from the date of discharge.\n\nOnce the TPA receives the claim documents, they acknowledge receipt via email and begin processing the claim. If additional information is required, the TPA will notify the employee via email and send reminders. If the required documents are not submitted within 30 days, the claim may be closed.\n\nIf the claim is found to be payable, the payment is made to the employee through NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer). If the claim is declined, a denial email is sent to the employee.\n\nThis process map clearly outlines the required actions, timelines, and decision points for both the insured and the TPA, ensuring transparency and clarity in the claim settlement process.\nClaim\n\n\n<figure>\n\nInsured visits non network\nhospital for treatment\n\nTakes discharge, pays for\ntreatment\n\nCollects all original\ndocuments, receipts and\ninvestigation reports from\nHospital\n\nSubmits all original\nHospital documents along\nwith filled claim form\nwithin 21 days from date\nof discharge to TPA\n\nTPA acknowledges\nreceipt of claim\ndocuments via email and\ncommences claim process\n\ninformation is required, TPA\nwill inform the employee via\nemail with reminders, If\ndocuments are not\nsubmitted within 30 days,\nclaim may be closed/\n\nIf claim is payable,\npayment will be made to\nemployee via NEFT\n\nIf claim is declined, denial\nmail will be sent.\n\n</figure>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Novartis Group-Employee Benefits Manual 2023-24\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"32\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## Making A Claim Claims Document Check List & Attachments\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Sr. No.</th>\n<th>Document Required (All in ORIGINAL)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Claim intimation is mandatory within 7 days from DOA and before DOD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Main Hospital bills in original (Original Hospital Payment Receipt with serial number, with bill no; signed and stamped by the hospital) &amp; itemized bills.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Discharge Card/Summary (original).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Attending doctors' bills and receipts and certificate regarding diagnosis (if separate from hospital bill) Indoor case papers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Original investigation reports or attested copies of Bills &amp; Receipts for Medicines, Investigations along with Doctors prescription in Original &amp; Laboratory</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Follow-up advice or letter for line of treatment after discharge from hospital, from Doctor.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Break up with details of Pharmacy items, Materials, Investigations even though it is there in the main bill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>In non- network hospitalization, please get the hospital and doctor's registration number in Hospital letterhead and get the same signed and stamped by the hospital.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>In case of accidents, please note FIR or MLC (medico legal certificate) is mandatory.

What should I do when I reach the hospital (NETWORK)?\n\n. These are hospitals where TPA has a tie up for the cashless hospitalization. There are two kinds of network hospitals; PPN Network\nhospitals where cashless services can be obtained for emergency and planned treatments and Standard (Non PPN) network\nhospitals where cashless services can be obtained for planned Hospitalization.\n\n. Once you have reached there, please show your ID card for identification. TPA will also send $a$ letter of credit (on pre-authorization)\nto the hospital to make sure that they extend credit facility. Please complete the pre-authorization procedure listed earlier. If the\npre-authorization is not done, you must collect all reports and discharge card when you get discharged. Please make sure that you\nsign the hospital bill before leaving the hospital. You can then submit the claim along with all the necessary supporting documents\nto TPA as a reimbursement . If, however, you go to a non network hospital , it is still advisable to fill the preauthorization form ( use\nthe copy attached with the Benefits Manual). Please fill the claim form, attach the relevant documents and send it to TPA office for\nreimbursement.\n\n\n### How can I claim my pre & post hospitalization expenses?\n\n. The policy covers pre-hospitalization expenses made prior to 60 days of hospitalization and incurred towards the same illness/\ndisease due to which hospitalization happens. It also covers all medical expenses for up to 60 days post discharge as advised by the\nMedical Practitioner. All bills with summary have to be sent to TPA for reimbursement within 7 days of incurring the expense.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Novartis Group-Employee Benefits Manual 2023-24\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"35\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## Making A Claim(1/2) Things To Remember\n\nAlways aim to pre-authorize your benefits with the TPA\nThis will help you in the following ways:\n\n. You will be informed in advance regarding your coverage for the treatment and whether it is covered under your medical plan or\nnot . This will help you know in advance if your claim may get rejected at a later stage and you do not end up paying out of pocket.\n\n. It will help you ensure that the treatment cost is appropriate and not inflated. as the TPA will be able to cross check costs with the\nhospital in question. This will also help TPA in planning your hospitalization expenditure such that you do not run out of the cover\nthat you are entitled to.\n\n. It will help TPA in registering the impending claim with the insurer\n\nEnsure your dependent list is always updated and claims submitted as per protocols\n\n· Please ensure that all your dependents are covered and have a valid card at the outset itself as it will not be possible to add\ndependents at a later stage. Submit your reimbursement claims within timelines from the hospital. Please do not postpone this till\nlater as it may mean that your claim gets rejected due to late submission .\n\n. Please check that your documents are submitted completely at the first instance itself and originals are submitted wherever\nrequested for . Do note that incomplete submissions will not be considered as exceptions by the insurers and will only delay the\nprocess further for you and a delay may lead to the claim getting closed. Please also retain a copy of all claim documents submitted\nto the insurer\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Novartis Group-Employee Benefits Manual 2023-24\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"36\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## Making A Claim (2/2) Things To Remember\n\nKnow that it is possible that benefits under your plan could be reduced v/s your eligible sum insured\n\nThe following are some common reasons for rejection although these are NOT the only reasons why a claim could be reduced\n\n· Limits for the specific ailment exceed the reasonable cap on ailments listed in the manual,\n\n· Claim amount exceeds the permissible limit under the policy for you ( denied to the extent of the excess),\n\n.

What should I do when I reach the hospital (NETWORK)?\n\n. These are hospitals where TPA has a tie up for the cashless hospitalization. There are two kinds of network hospitals; PPN Network\nhospitals where cashless services can be obtained for emergency and planned treatments and Standard (Non PPN) network\nhospitals where cashless services can be obtained for planned Hospitalization.\n\n. Once you have reached there, please show your ID card for identification. TPA will also send $a$ letter of credit (on pre-authorization)\nto the hospital to make sure that they extend credit facility. Please complete the pre-authorization procedure listed earlier. If the\npre-authorization is not done, you must collect all reports and discharge card when you get discharged. Please make sure that you\nsign the hospital bill before leaving the hospital. You can then submit the claim along with all the necessary supporting documents\nto TPA as a reimbursement . If, however, you go to a non network hospital , it is still advisable to fill the preauthorization form ( use\nthe copy attached with the Benefits Manual). Please fill the claim form, attach the relevant documents and send it to TPA office for\nreimbursement.\n\nHow can I claim my pre & post hospitalization expenses?\n\n. The policy covers pre-hospitalization expenses made prior to 60 days of hospitalization and incurred towards the same illness/\ndisease due to which hospitalization happens. It also covers all medical expenses for up to 60 days post discharge as advised by the\nMedical Practitioner. All bills with summary have to be sent to TPA for reimbursement within 7 days of incurring the expense.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"35\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n### Making A Claim(1/2) Things To Remember\n\nAlways aim to pre-authorize your benefits with the TPA\nThis will help you in the following ways:\n\n. You will be informed in advance regarding your coverage for the treatment and whether it is covered under your medical plan or\nnot . This will help you know in advance if your claim may get rejected at a later stage and you do not end up paying out of pocket.\n\n. It will help you ensure that the treatment cost is appropriate and not inflated. as the TPA will be able to cross check costs with the\nhospital in question. This will also help TPA in planning your hospitalization expenditure such that you do not run out of the cover\nthat you are entitled to.\n\n. It will help TPA in registering the impending claim with the insurer\n\nEnsure your dependent list is always updated and claims submitted as per protocols\n\n· Please ensure that all your dependents are covered and have a valid card at the outset itself as it will not be possible to add\ndependents at a later stage. Submit your reimbursement claims within timelines from the hospital. Please do not postpone this till\nlater as it may mean that your claim gets rejected due to late submission .\n\n. Please check that your documents are submitted completely at the first instance itself and originals are submitted wherever\nrequested for . Do note that incomplete submissions will not be considered as exceptions by the insurers and will only delay the\nprocess further for you and a delay may lead to the claim getting closed. Please also retain a copy of all claim documents submitted\nto the insurer\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"36\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n#### Making A Claim (2/2) Things To Remember\n\nKnow that it is possible that benefits under your plan could be reduced v/s your eligible sum insured\n\nThe following are some common reasons for rejection although these are NOT the only reasons why a claim could be reduced\n\n.

Once all relevant documents are received, the insurer initiates the claims processing. The next step involves claim investigation and review after all required documents have been submitted.\n\nA decision point follows, where the claim is either approved or rejected. If the claim is approved, a cheque is sent to the human resources department or the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) details are shared with HR. HR then communicates this information to the employee or beneficiary. If the claim is rejected, the insurer provides a valid reason for the rejection to the HR, employee, or beneficiary.\n\nThis process ensures a structured workflow for claim submission, investigation, approval, or rejection, with clear responsibilities and communication channels at each stage.\nEmployee / Beneficiary\nnotifies HR, who in turn would\nintimate Insurer and submit required\nclaims documents within 14 days of\nthe event\n\nOn obtaining all relevant documents,\nInsurer begins processing the claims\n\nClaim Investigation and Review\npost submission of all the\nrequired documents\n\nYes\n\nIs claim\napproved\n?\n\nNo\n\nOn approval, the cheque is sent to the HR\nor NEFT details shared with HR, from\nwhere the information is shared to the\nEmployee / Beneficiary\n\nOn rejection of the claim, Insurer would\nprovide a valid reason for the rejection to\nHR / Employee / Beneficiary\n\n</figure>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"42\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# Making A Claim Document Check List\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Sr No.</td>\n<td>Document Details for Accidental Death</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Completed Claim form with photocopy of ID card</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Copy of postmortem examination report</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Copy of the first information report from police department / copy of the medico-legal certificate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Original death summary from the hospital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Copy of the legal heir certificate, if the claim is for the death of the principle insured</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Viscera Report for death due to poisoning OR snake bite</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Death certificate from Municipal Authority OR Gram Panchayat (Applicable for claim reported from rural areas)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Salary slip prior to Accident</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Sr No.</td>\n<td>Document Details for Disablement Claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Completed Claim form with photocopy of ID card</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Original detailed discharge summary / day care summary from the hospital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Treating doctor's certificate giving details of injuries (How, when and where injury sustained)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Copy of the first information report from police department / copy of the medico-legal certificate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>First consultation letter and subsequent treatment papers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Disability certificate from a concerned specialist affiliated with government hospital confirming the extent and nature of disability</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThis is an indicative list of documents and there may be additional documents required by the insurer.\nIt is mandatory to provide the details for nomination of beneficiary.\n\n\n<figure>\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"AON\" -->\n\n</figure>\n\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"43\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# Making A Claim Document Check List\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Sr No.</td>\n<td>Document Details for Temporary Total Disablement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Completed Claim form with photocopy of ID card</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Salary Slip prior to Accident</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Fitness Certificate by the treating doctor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Medical/Hospital Documents if any</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThis is an indicative list of documents and there may be\nadditional documents required by the insurer.\nIt is mandatory to provide the details for nomination of\nbeneficiary.\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Sr No.</td>\n<td>Document Details for Emergency Medical Expenses/Emergency Expenses (Accident Only)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Completed Claim form with photocopy of ID card</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Original consolidated hospital bill with breakup of each Item, duly signed by the insured</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Original payment receipt of the hospital bill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Original bills, original payment receipts and reports for investigation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Original medicine bills and receipts with corresponding prescriptions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Original invoice/bills for implants (viz.

Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and\ncollaboration tools and services, including Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Linkedln. Microsoft 365 brings together\nOffice 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with Al-backed\ntools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and\ndata protection. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and\nbusiness process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together communications,\nknowledge, learning, resources, and insights. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation Al with business data\nin the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications.\n\nTogether with the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and our AI offerings bring a new era of\ncollaborative applications that optimize business functions, processes, and applications to better serve customers and\nemployees while creating more business value. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity\ngains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic\nlabor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.\n\n\n### Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nAs digital transformation and adoption of AI accelerates and revolutionizes more business workstreams, organizations\nin every sector across the globe can address challenges that will have a fundamental impact on their success. For\nenterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases,\nchanges the very core of products and services. We continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing\nto meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing\ninfrastructure and datacenters.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at\nsignificantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer,\ngeographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources;\nand multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time\nto value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency,\ndeveloper productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and\nneeds for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge\ndevices, from Internet of Things (\"loT\") sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure\nedge workloads.\n\nOur AI platform, Azure AI, is helping organizations transform, bringing intelligence and insights to the hands of their\nemployees and customers to solve their most pressing challenges. Organizations large and small are deploying Azure\nAI solutions to achieve more at scale, more easily, with the proper enterprise-level and responsible AI protections.\n\nWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI, a leading Al research and deployment company. We deploy OpenAl's\nmodels across our consumer and enterprise products. As OpenAl's exclusive cloud provider, Azure powers all of\nOpenAl's workloads. We have also increased our investments in the development and deployment of specialized\nsupercomputing systems to accelerate OpenAl's research.\n\nOur hybrid infrastructure offers integrated, end-to-end security, compliance, identity, and management capabilities to\nsupport the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. Our\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"4\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\nindustry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific\ncustomizations. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-\npremises management platform.\n\nNuance, a leader in conversational AI and ambient intelligence across industries including healthcare, financial\nservices, retail, and telecommunications, joined Microsoft in 2022. Microsoft and Nuance enable organizations to\naccelerate their business goals with security-focused, cloud-based solutions infused with AI.\n\nWe are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh\nenables organizations to create custom, immersive experiences for the workplace to help bring remote and hybrid\nworkers and teams together.\n\nThe ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. The Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform is a leading\ncloud data platform that fully integrates databases, analytics, and governance. The platform empowers organizations\nto invest more time creating value rather than integrating and managing their data. Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end,\nunified analytics platform that brings together all the data and analytics tools that organizations need.\n\nGitHub Copilot is at the forefront of AI-powered software development, giving developers a new tool to write code\neasier and faster so they can focus on more creative problem-solving. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a\ndeveloper tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows,\nor any other cloud or client platform.\n\nWindows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business with Windows 365, a desktop operating system that's\nalso a cloud service. From another internet-connected device, including Android or macOS devices, users can run\nWindows 365, just like a virtual machine.\n\nAdditionally, we are extending our infrastructure beyond the planet, bringing cloud computing to space. Azure Orbital\nis a fully managed ground station as a service for fast downlinking of data.\n\n\n## Create More Personal Computing\n\nWe strive to make computing more personal, enabling users to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging,\nand dynamic ways.\n\nWindows 11 offers innovations focused on enhancing productivity, including Windows Copilot with centralized AI\nassistance and Dev Home to help developers become more productive. Windows 11 security and privacy features\ninclude operating system security, application security, and user and identity security.\n\nThrough our Search, News, Mapping, and Browser services, Microsoft delivers unique trust, privacy, and safety\nfeatures. In February 2023, we launched an all new, AI-powered Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with\nBing Chat to deliver better search, more complete answers, and the ability to generate content. Microsoft Edge is our\nfast and secure browser that helps protect users' data. Quick access to Al-powered tools, apps, and more within\nMicrosoft Edge's sidebar enhance browsing capabilities.\n\nWe are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories,\nand stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and other\nSurface products.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in gaming content, community, and cloud services. We have broadened our approach to\nhow we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played,\nincluding subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and new devices from third-party manufacturers so players can\nengage across PC, console, and mobile. In January 2022, we announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc., a\nleader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher.\n\n\n### Our Future Opportunity\n\nWe are focused on helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of\ntheir digital spend while leading the new AI wave across our solution areas. We continue to develop complete, intelligent\nsolutions for our customers that empower people to be productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"5\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\nsimplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term,\nwhich we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\n· Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights,\nand improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another.\n\n· Building and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous computing to unleash new\nexperiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n\n· Applying Al and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many types of work, and provide\nsubstantive productivity gains using natural methods of communication.\n\n· Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance,\nidentity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\n\n· Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any\ndevices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming.\n\n· Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased\nengagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Edge, Bing, Xbox\nGame Pass, and more.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales\nmotions.\n\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n\n### Commitment to Sustainability\n\nMicrosoft's approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we\ncommitted to being a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.\n\nIn May 2023, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress during fiscal year\n2022. We continued to make progress on our goals, with our overall emissions declining by 0.5 percent. While our\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued to decline, Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3\nrepresented 96 percent of our total emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and the use of\nour products across our customers.\n\nA few examples of our continued progress include:\n\n· Signed new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5\ngigawatts.\n\n· Contracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million cubic\nmeters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects.\n\n· Diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational\nfootprint.\n\n· Protected 12,270 acres of land in Belize - more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use around the world.\n\nMicrosoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution can\nbe offered by any single company, organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the sustainability needs\nof our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an environmental sustainability\nmanagement platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables organizations to record, report, and\nreduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. These digital tools can interoperate with business systems and unify data\nintelligence for organizations.\n\n\n### Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\n\nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American\ncommunities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees' communities, and beyond. Our Racial\nEquity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed\nby 2025.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"6\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\n· Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black\nand African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.\n\n· Engaging our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster\nsocietal change and create new opportunities.\n\n· Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: building on our momentum by adding a $150 million\ninvestment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx\nleaders in the United States by 2025.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and\nscale a number of projects and programs, including:\n\n· Working with 103 unique organizations in 165 cities and counties on our Justice Reform Initiative to\nempower communities and advance racial equity and fairness in the justice system.\n\n· Increasing access to affordable broadband, devices, and digital literacy training across 14 geographies,\nincluding 11 cities and three states in the Black Rural south.\n\n· Growing our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities program, which uses\ndata, technology, and partnerships to help more than 2,000 local organizations to modernize and streamline\noperations.\n\n· Expanding our Technology Education and Learning Support (\"TEALS\") program to reach nearly 400 high\nschools in 21 communities to increase computer science opportunities for Black and African American\nstudents.\n\nWe exceeded our 2020 goal to double the percentage of our transaction volumes with Black- and African American-\nowned financial institutions by 2023. We are also increasing investment activity with Black- and African American-\nowned asset managers, which now represent 45 percent of our external manager group, enabling increased funds into\nlocal communities. We also met our goal of creating a $100 million program focused on mission-driven banks. We\nenriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African\nAmerican-owned suppliers. We also increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative\nby more than 250 percent, surpassing our initial goal.\n\nWe have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. As of June 2023, we are 93 percent\nof the way to our 2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers in the U.S.\n(below director level), and 107 percent of the way for Black and African American directors (people managers and\nindividual contributors). We are 28 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers (below director level)\nand 74 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx directors.\n\n\n## Investing in Digital Skills\n\nAfter helping over 80 million jobseekers around the world access digital skilling resources, we introduced a new Skills\nfor Jobs initiative to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to\ndevelop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our Skills for Jobs initiative brings together learning\nresources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on\ndata insights drawn from LinkedIn's Economic Graph.\n\nWe also launched a national campaign to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the cybersecurity workforce by\n2025, representing half of the country's workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of\ncharge to all of the nation's higher education institutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing\nscholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. We have expanded the cyber skills initiative to 27\nadditional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces,\npartnering with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.\n\nGenerative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to\nuse it. To address this, in June 2023 we launched a new AI Skills Initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the\npower of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of\ngenerative AI. We also launched a new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on generative\nAI and are providing greater access to digital learning events and resources for everyone to improve their AI fluency.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"7\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\n\n# HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\n## Overview\n\nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and\nour success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize\nthe potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that\nenables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 120,000 in the U.S. and 101,000\ninternationally. Of the total employed people, 89,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product\nsupport, and consulting services; 72,000 were in product research and development; 45,000 were in sales and\nmarketing; and 15,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining\nagreements.\n\n\n## Our Culture\n\nMicrosoft's culture is grounded in growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow,\noperating as one company instead of multiple siloed businesses.\n\nOur employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and\nemployee needs globally. Employees participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover a variety of topics such\nas thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. We also collect Daily Signals employee\nsurvey responses, giving us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees. In addition to Employee\nSignals and Daily Signals surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, exit surveys, internal Viva Engage channels,\nemployee Q&A sessions, and our internal AskHR Service support.\n\nDiversity and inclusion are core to our business model, and we hold ourselves accountable for driving global systemic\nchange in our workforce and creating an inclusive work environment. We support multiple highly active Employee\nResource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees\nwho identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described\nin our 2022 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an\nevaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly\ndisclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including:\n\n· Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with\ndata by job types, levels, and segments of our business.\n\n· Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).\n\n· Disability representation.\n\n· Pay equity (see details below).\n\n\n## Total Rewards and Pay Equity\n\nWe develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly\ndifferentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs\nreinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend\nrewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our\ncolleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation\nopportunity is highly differentiated and is market competitive.\n\nIn order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base\nsalaries of salaried employees would remain at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for\nrewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our practice of investing in stock for all rewards-\neligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees.\n\nSince 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion report. In 2022, we reported\nthat all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white\ncounterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts who are men, and that\nwomen outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men. In\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"8\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\nthis year's report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from\n12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce.\n\nIn addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all\nemployees regardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the\nanalysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and\ntotal pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to\nincrease representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay\nequity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce.\n\nOur intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive\ncompensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.\n\n\n## Wellbeing and Hybrid Work\n\nMicrosoft is committed to supporting our employees' wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives. We\nhave invested significantly in wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical,\nemotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance\nProgram, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, disability accommodations, savings and investment tools,\nadoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program\nhelps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working.\n\nWe introduced Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guidance to better support leaders, managers, and employees in hybrid\nwork scenarios. Our ongoing survey data shows that 93% of employees value the flexibility related to work location,\nwork site, and work hours, and 78% are satisfied with the quality of connection with co-workers. There is no one-size-\nfits-all approach to flexible work at Microsoft. As a company, we will continue to leverage data and research to inform\ndecision making, balancing the needs of business, team, and individual.\n\n\n## Learning and Development\n\nWe offer a range of learning opportunities, including personalized opportunities on our internal and external learning\nportals, in-classroom learning, required learning on compliance and company culture, on-the-job advancement\nopportunities, and manager coaching. We also provide customized manager learning, new employee orientation, and\ntools for operating in a flexible hybrid work environment.\n\nAll Microsoft employees globally access our single Viva Learning tool for both required and personal choice learning.\nThis includes courses focused on our core principles and compliance matters, such as Business Conduct, Privacy,\nSecurity Foundations, and Harassment Prevention. We also deliver skills training for employees based on their\nprofession and role discipline.\n\nWe have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between 20-33 hours of compulsory training on\nleadership and management and are assigned additional targeted training on an ongoing basis related to people\nmanagement, compliance, and culture.\n\n\n# OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business\nProcesses, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a\ncomprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives\nacross the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and\nrational allocation of resources within businesses.\n\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 -\nSegment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"9\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n\n\n## Productivity and Business Processes\n\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,\ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms.

GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.\n\n\n# Enterprise Services\n\nEnterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, and Nuance Professional Services,\nassist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, Microsoft desktop solutions, and\nNuance conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions, along with providing training and certification to developers\nand IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\n\n\n## Competition\n\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source\nofferings. Azure's competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters\nwith our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of\nbusinesses of all sizes and complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers such as Amazon\nBedrock, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Google Al, as well as products from other emerging competitors, many of which\nare also current or potential partners, including Meta's LLAMA2 and other open source solutions. Our Enterprise\nMobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security\nsolution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. We believe our cloud's global scale, coupled\nwith our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity\nchallenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.\n\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by\ncompanies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard,\nIBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all\ncomputer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system, and many contribute to Linux operating\nsystem development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible\napplications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies,\nsuch as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.\n\nWe compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software\nvendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet\nand intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused\non the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial\ncompetitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies,\nIBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux,\nMySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\n\nOur database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM,\nOracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management\nand server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our\nproducts for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also\nagainst open source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and\nRuby on Rails.\n\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and\nproductivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and\nsoftware applications, security, and manageability.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"12\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\nOur Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business\nplanning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche\nbusinesses focused on specific technologies.\n\n\n## More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the\nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n· Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (\"Windows OEM\") and other non-volume licensing of the\nWindows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating\nsystem, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows\nIoT.\n\n· Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.\n\n· Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content\n(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming,\nadvertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services.\n\n. Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and\nthird-party affiliates.\n\n\n### Windows\n\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling\nconsistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted\nsignificantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the\ndevices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\n\n· The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n\n· Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.\n\n· Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n\n· Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\n\n· Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n\n· Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts\nfrom local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows\nversions licensed.\n\n· Constraints in the supply chain of device components.\n\n· Piracy.\n\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud\nservices such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for\nvolume licensing and Software Assurance (\"SA\"), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial\nrevenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the\nnumber of PCs sold in a given year.\n\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas,\nincluding mobile devices and cloud offerings.\n\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating\nsystems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.\n\n\n### Devices\n\nWe design and sell devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable\npeople and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated\nMicrosoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"13\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n\nproductive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product\nroadmap, and expanding into new categories.\n\n\n### Gaming\n\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content,\ncommunity, and cloud services. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of\nfirst-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios\nand content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming\nexperiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a\ncurated library of over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\n\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across\na variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across\nsubscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We've seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and\nmobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are focused on\ngrowing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible.\n\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-\nenabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified\napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer\nbase. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising.\nGrowth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability\nof games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices\nused to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.\n\n\n### Search and News Advertising\n\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a\nglobal audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing Chat capabilities are key tools to enable user acquisition and\nengagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to\nfirst-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize\nsearch offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant\ncontent on advertising offerings.\n\n\n#### Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from\nApple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security,\nan easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those\nthat enable productivity.\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination\nof high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many\nof which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming\nservices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of\nentertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from\nNintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is\neffectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant\ninnovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and\ncontinued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like\nMeta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"14\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1\n\n\n# OPERATIONS\n\nWe have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order\nprocessing, billing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The center\nin Ireland supports the African, Asia-Pacific, European, and Middle East regions; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia,\nAtlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond, Washington,\nReno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico support the American regions.\n\nIn addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to\nidentify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the\nevolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on\nthe availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics\nprocessing units (\"GPUs\") and other components.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we\nhave the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.\nHowever, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended\ndisruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n\n# RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n· Cloud and Al - focuses on making IT professionals, developers, partners, independent software vendors,\nand their systems more productive and efficient through development of Azure AI platform and cloud\ninfrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub),\nAI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n\n· Strategic Missions and Technologies - focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with\ntransformative potential for the future of cloud computing and continued company growth across quantum\ncomputing, Azure Space & Missions Engineering, telecommunications, and Microsoft Federal Sales and\nDelivery.\n\n· Experiences and Devices - focuses on delivering high value end-user experiences across our products,\nservices, and devices, including Microsoft 365, Windows, Microsoft Teams, Search (including Microsoft\nEdge and Bing Chat) and other advertising-based services, and the Surface line of devices.\n\n· Microsoft Security - focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of services that protect our customers'\ndigital infrastructure through cloud platform and application security, data protection and governance,\nidentity and network access, and device management.\n\n· Technology and Research - focuses on fundamental research, product and business incubations, and\nforward-looking AI innovations that span infrastructure, services, and applications.\n\n· LinkedIn - focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs\nand the way businesses hire, market, sell, and learn.\n\n· Gaming - focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help\ngrow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.\n\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer\ntechnical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and\nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as\npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before\nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide\napplication vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also\ncreate product documentation internally.\n\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally\nto ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and\nhardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing\npatents and currently have a portfolio of over 70,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"15\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n\nworldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we\nalso engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees' products.\nFrom time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire\ngroups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At\ntimes, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as\npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting\nand enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also\ncause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.\n\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and\nservices, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially\ndependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\n\n\n## Investing in the Future\n\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users,\nto initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad\nadoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we\nbelieve offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our\nassessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a\nwide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, Al,\ndevices, and operating systems.\n\nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate\nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us\nremain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.\n\nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities,\nand as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the\nresults across the company.\n\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research\nis one of the world's largest corporate research organizations, often working in close collaboration with top universities\naround the world, and is focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other\ndisciplines. Our investment in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes\nto our innovation.\n\n\n# DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\n\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and\nresellers. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises\nand public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation\nrequirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and\nother partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our\nproducts and services.\n\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they\nsell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs\nalso sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the\ncapability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them\nis managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering\none or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with\nmany regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"16\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n\nPC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the\nMicrosoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements\nand Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web\nagencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (\"Enterprise Agreement\nSoftware Advisors\" or \"ESA\"). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate\ncustomers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many\nof these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search,\nand gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are\ndesigned to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\"LSP\"),\ndistributors, value-added resellers (\"VAR\"), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach\norganizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs,\nand VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate\nas resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program\nfor reselling cloud services.\n\nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized\nreplicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We\ndistribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support\npersonnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners\nproviding vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n\n# LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license\nsoftware to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of\nproducts and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different\nprograms designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various\nparts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also\nprovides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA\nis included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.\n\n\n## Volume Licensing Programs\n\n\n### Enterprise Agreement\n\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility\nto buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium\nor large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-\nyear period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.\n\n\n### Microsoft Customer Agreement\n\nA Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital\nexperience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers\nover time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"17\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n\n\n### Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement\n\nA Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to,\nactivate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers\nto acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.\n\n\n### Microsoft Products and Services Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license\ncloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-\nexpiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers\nthat purchase perpetual licenses.\n\n\n### Open Value\n\nOpen Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements\nare designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over\na three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or\nsubscribe to licenses and SA is included.\n\n\n### Select Plus\n\nA Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at\nany affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual\nlicenses and SA is optional.\n\n\n## Partner Programs\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need\nin combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud\nreseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision,\nmanage, and support their customer subscriptions.\n\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software\nvendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications\nto their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on\nconsumption.\n\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other\napplications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.\n\n\n# CUSTOMERS\n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector\ninstitutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly\nupon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"18\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n\n\n# INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nOur executive officers as of July 27, 2023 were as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Position with the Company</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Satya Nadella</td>\n<td>55</td>\n<td>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Judson B.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below,\nthat could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of\nour common stock.\n\n\n## STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\n\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower\nrevenue or operating margins.\n\n\n### Competition in the technology sector\n\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources\nto small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical,\nmarketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which\nwe compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions\nof new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products,\ndevices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\n\n\n### Competition among platform-based ecosystems\n\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many\nparticipants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,\napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the\nmarketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that\nprovide competing platforms.\n\n· A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements\nof a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal\ncomputers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors\npursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform,\nincluding applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to\nclaim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-\nintegrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to\na vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n\n· We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant\ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones\nand tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of\nthe device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the\npast were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to\na personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application\ndevelopers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no\ncost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing\nplatforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products\nmade by our original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") partners, which may affect their commitment to our\nplatform.\n\n· Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases.\nThe variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing\ndecisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching\nplatforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and\nensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete\nwith competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\noperating margins. Competitors' rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict\nour ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business\nmodel objectives.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## PART I Item 1A\n\n\n### Business model competition\n\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n\n· Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business\nmodel, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software\nrevenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in\nresearch and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products.\nMany of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n\n. We are investing in artificial intelligence (\"Al\") across the entire company and infusing generative Al\ncapabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a\nhighly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant development and operational costs\nto build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our\ncustomers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory\ndevelopments, and public scrutiny.\n\n· Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by\nselling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these\ncompetitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n\n· Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no\ncost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products\nand services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source\nproducts. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased\noperating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower\nrevenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our\nbusiness involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to\ncompete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and\nambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing\nand deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving.\nDevices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user's choice of which\ncloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may\npresent enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The\nWindows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational\nchanges to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings\nare connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (\"loT\"), a network of distributed and interconnected devices\nemploying sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and\nambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge.\nWe may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\n\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud\ncomputing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed\nin cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n\n. Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and\nmarket share.\n\n· Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of\ncomputing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as\nsensors and other IoT endpoints.\n\n. Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n\n· Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the\nsecurity of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n\n· Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and\necosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n## PART I Item 1A\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not\neffective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we\nfail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the\ninfrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating\nincome.\n\nSome users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include\nunauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure\nto pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or\nlaunching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse\nare not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage.\n\n\n# RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\n\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will\ncontinue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and\ntechnologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure,\nOffice 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new Al platform\nservices and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition\nof a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices,\nand HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors,\nincluding innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our\nlatest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new\nsoftware and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue\nfrom new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services\nmay not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will\nnot be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like\nMicrosoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices\nacross our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by\nregulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product\nand feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\n\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in\nnew releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to\ncontinue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business\nstrategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March\n2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced\na definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third\nphase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant\nchallenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on\nour investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating\nand retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other\nbusinesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate\nchanging circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement.\nThe success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance\nour existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies' ability to meet our\npolicies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected\nto realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced\nefficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant\ncharge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit\nfrom those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable\nintangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances,\nindicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"23\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1A\" -->\n\ndecline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in\nindustry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record,\na significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill\nor amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\n\n\n# CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\n\n\n## Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\n\n### Security of our information technology\n\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations,\nincluding state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our\ncustomers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying\nmalicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other\ninfrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social\nengineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other\nsensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data, or acting in a\ncoordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-\nsponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our\ncustomers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing\nconflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized\naccess to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access\nwhen no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users' security or\nsystems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware\nthrough software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of\ndetecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities\nor new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats\ncan have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of\nour partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our\nsystems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of\ntheir data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming\nour reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to\nransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of\nattacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware\ncan be introduced to a software provider's customers, including us, through software updates.\n\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and\ntechnologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers\nusing methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI\nmodels in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal\nsecurity controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations\nin jurisdictions worldwide.\n\n\n### Security of our products, services, devices, and customers' data\n\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers' decisions to purchase or use our products or\nservices across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us\nwhose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also\naffect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including\nhardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of\ntheir data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services,\nincluding many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises\nor cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero day\") vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early\ncalendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product\ncan persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if\nthe attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1A\" -->\n\ncustomers' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace\ndigital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our\nusers' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security\npractices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious\nsoftware impacting a customer's use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source\nsoftware into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products\nsusceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because\ngenerative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that\nrely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.\n\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may\ninclude systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and\nproducts, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result,\nwe may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a\nmore secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase\nour customers' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our\ntechnology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state\nof the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical\nsophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these\nsettings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability\nto review and reset these defaults.\n\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We\nare committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have\nactionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and\nsupport on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks\nfor all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves\non-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers'\ncomputing environments.\n\n\n### Development and deployment of defensive measures\n\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers' systems,\nwe must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability\nfeatures, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well\nas those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when\nsoftware updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network,\nproducts, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and\ninformation about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries\nsuch as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we\nmust engineer our products and services.\n\nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail\nto do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues,\nor reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products\nor subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting\ntheir existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers,\nand third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating\nsystems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt\nadequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived\nvulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit\nour exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve\ncommercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\n\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem\nof third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting\nit, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow\nthe number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1A\n\npersonal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence\nof an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security\ncontrols across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our\ntraining of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper\ndisclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have\nlimited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse\ncould harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect\npersonal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our\ncustomers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment\nwe host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal\norders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations\non government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that\nthe collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products\nor services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities.\nAdditional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to\ndetermine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules\nor actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other\nMicrosoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or\ntechnical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use\nof this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from\nscraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit,\nthus diminishing the value of our products and services.\n\n\n## Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.\n\n\n### Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\n\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties,\nincluding GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or\nuser engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from\nusers impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of Al technologies, dissemination of\ninformation that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our\nproducts or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or\nresponding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these\ninvestments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n### Other digital safety abuses\n\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or\nillegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale,\nthe limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such\ncontent may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to\nmake platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect\nthis to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage\nif we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\nThe development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the\nintelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The\nloT's great potential also carries substantial risks. loT products and services may contain defects in design,\nmanufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has\nmultiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or\ncontrol. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have\nlimited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling\nof IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health\nand safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals\nor businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our\ncosts, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"26\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1A\" -->\n\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are\nbuilding AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our\ncustomers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic\npartner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our\ndevices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with\nmany innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI\nalgorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased\ninformation. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate\nAI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of\nAI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as\nintended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with\ninnovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action,\nlegal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating Al in jurisdictions such as the European Union (\"EU\"),\nnew applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational\nharm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions\nthat have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are\ncontroversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political\nissues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\n\n# OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an\nadequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our\nproducts and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease\ndatacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our\nwebsites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable\nenergy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The\ncost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to\na clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands\ncontinue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of\nexisting services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365,\nOneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of Al features and/or\nfunctionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided\nby third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex,\nand requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It\nrequires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and\nreliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures,\nincluding temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable\npower supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and\nuser experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions,\ndamage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may\nadversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices,\nand other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or\nassociated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls,\nsafety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or\nwarranty repairs.\n\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated\nsoftware we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers\nincreasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are\ninterdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability\nissues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage\nto our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability.\nAlthough our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no\nassurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"27\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1A\" -->\n\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same\nsuppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed\nor become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory\nchanges that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in\nreduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products\nand services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory\nadjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other\nhardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting\nin shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\n\n\n# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\n\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market\nour products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are\nactively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the\nEU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive\nconduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to\nscrutinize our business.\n\nFor example, the European Commission (\"the Commission\") closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft\nproducts and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats,\nprogramming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can\nreceive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws.\n\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices\nfor our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that\nwe fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign\ngovernments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws\nthat exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n\nCompetition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits\nof our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes\nfrom them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The\noutcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing\nus to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely\naffecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions\non acquisitions that may reduce their value.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal\npenalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws and\nregulations (\"Anti-Corruption Laws\") prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the\naccounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls.\nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from\nemployees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws.\nPeriodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and\nforeign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU\nWhistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in\ndifferent forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit\ncompetitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote\nsubstantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and\ninternal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or\nagents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in\nsignificant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct\nof our business, and damage to our reputation.\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside\nthe U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the $E U ,$ and other countries prohibit most\nbusiness with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"28\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1A\n\nand services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from\nintegrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review\nof transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign\nadversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nPeriods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and\nrapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and\n(2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with\nsanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary\nfines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or\nresult in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and\ncloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal\nrequirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example,\nwhile the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\"DPF\") has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers\nof personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which\ncould cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have\nand may again block the use of certain U.S .- based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and\nother markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"),\nwhich applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services\noffered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently,\nthe EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the\nDigital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and\nservices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve\nsubstantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced\ndemand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet\ntheir obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less\nattractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If\nwe fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by\ncustomers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private\nlawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines\nassessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions\naround the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding,\nlaws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\n\nOur investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we\ndeliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of\nquality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the\nexpected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft\npractices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements,\nincluding data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our\ncustomer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result\nin increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms.\nCompliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some\njurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders\nto stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.\n\nExisting and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those\nthat may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user\nprivacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions,\nincluding EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of\nour services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being\nsubjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and\nprivate litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is\ninconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as\ncookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure,\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"29\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1A\n\nreporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may\nincrease the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital\naccessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and\norganizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation,\nwhich could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may\nentail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market.\n\nHow these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes\nmay be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments' approach to enforcement, and our\nproducts and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations\nmay involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results\nof operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant\nactivity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other\nstakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements,\nwe could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.\n\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of\nclaims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major\nnew product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims,\nemployment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant\nmonetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and\nother claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\nA material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an\nunfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue\nfrom government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private\ncommercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these\ncontracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and\npenalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to\nterminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic\nfunding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products\nand services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\n\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business,\nthere are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example,\ncompliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") and possible future legislative changes may\nrequire the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and\nguidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information\nand perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for\nincome taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken.\nIn addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax\ndisputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the\nprimary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation,\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our\nconsolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\n\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in\ncountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about\ncertain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition,\nchanges in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental\nlaw changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions'\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1A\n\n\n# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\n\nWe face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our\nbusiness and operating results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed\ncopying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of\nharmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.\n\nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue\nfor licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or\nmay contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software\nwill also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our\nintellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected.\n\nSource code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our\nbusiness. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become\neasier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue\nand operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described\nelsewhere in these risk factors.\n\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe\ntheir intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms\nthat are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages\nto satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages\nor injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing\ntechnologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual\nproperty rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue\nto do so.\n\n\n# GENERAL RISKS\n\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation\nand brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands\ncould be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply\nchain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy\ngroups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions.\nDamage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n\n· The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners\ndo not like.\n\n· Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.\n\n· Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.\n\nThe proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our\nbrands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most\nhighly qualified employees.\n\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including\ninflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely\naffect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business\nspending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\n\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our\nsoftware have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such\nas the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they\nhave purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"31\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1A\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to\ngeneral credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that\naffect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If\nglobal financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to\nan actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could\ndetermine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that\ncould adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems\nor operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other\ncatastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions.\nOur corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential\nbusiness operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley\narea of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or\ndisruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power\ngrids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and\nsolutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity\nmanagement plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of\ngeneral economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our\nability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing\nand budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for\nhardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market\ninterventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and\nprofitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with\nsome public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\n\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward\nwill depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals'\nactions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or\nfinancial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk\nFactors.\n\nWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may\nadversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.\n\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear.\nEnvironmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may\naffect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business.\nChanges in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to\ndevelop software and provide cloud-based services.\n\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world\nand a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational,\neconomic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic\ndevelopments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our\ninternational growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including\ndeterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and\nmanaging foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the\nenvironment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments.\nChanges to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in\nhigher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other\ndevelopments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed\nor emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain\nregions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of\noperations.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"32\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART I Item 1A\n\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on\nsuccessfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets.\nThe market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and\nreputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important\nto our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive\ndomestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional\ntalent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our\nrecruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our\nlong-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees\ncould hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our\nworkforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.\nOur global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and\ninternationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in\nworkers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result\nin higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new\nrelationships with worker representatives.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"33\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4\" -->\n\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and\nExchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2023 that remain\nunresolved.\n\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 16 million square feet of\nspace located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other\ngeneral and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 11 million square feet of owned space\nsituated on approximately 530 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately 5 million square\nfeet of space we lease.\n\nWe own and lease other facilities domestically and internationally, primarily for offices, datacenters, and research and\ndevelopment. The largest owned international properties include space in the following locations: China, India, Ireland,\nand the Netherlands.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is\nintended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A\nis provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the\nresults of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. For a discussion\nof the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.\n\n\n### OVERVIEW\n\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet\nto achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are\ncreating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (\"Al\"), that deliver better, faster, and more effective\nsolutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-\nsector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.\n\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and\nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global\naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees;\nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing,\nmarketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\n\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\n\n· Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\n\n· Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial\ngrowth of 13%.\n\n· Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer\nsubscribers increased to 67.0 million.\n\n· LinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\n\n· Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\n\n· Server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services\ngrowth of 29%.\n\n· Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\"Windows OEM\") revenue decreased 25%.\n\n· Devices revenue decreased 24%.\n\n· Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\n\n· Xbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\n\n· Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\n\n\n#### Industry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each\nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform\nthe industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of\nresearch and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users,\nindustry trends, and competitive forces.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"36\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n#### Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are\ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in\nthe cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for\nour software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs\nand may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter\nlocations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing\ndemand for Al services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy,\nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices\nare primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability\nto use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However,\nsome of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions\nat these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university\nand industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working\nenvironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products\nand businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue\nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates\nmay significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies\nreduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\n\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer\ndemand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2\nbillion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses\nof $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease\nconsolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter\nof fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we\neliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our\ncapital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we\nare consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results\nthrough the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to\nevaluate our real estate needs.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n\n#### Seasonality\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second\nquarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending\nby consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during\nthe period.\n\n\n#### Change in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments\nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from\nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the\ncarrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"37\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\neffect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income\nof $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent\nCloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent\nwith our internal management reporting. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we\ninternally manage and monitor our business.\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic\nData of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n\n### Metrics\n\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation\nof resources.

The increase in our effective tax\nrate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer\nof intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to\nthe U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible\nlow-taxed income tax.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in\nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional\noperations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a\nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our\nU.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In\nfiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes\nwas $35.9 billion.\n\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In\nFebruary 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to\n2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007\nto 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second\nquarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a\npayment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a\nmaterial impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for\nincome tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer\npricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information\ncurrently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues\nwithin the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\nsubject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The\nresolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n# NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current\nyear non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance\nexpenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease\nconsolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer\nof intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by\nproviding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For\ncomparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"44\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\nevaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a\nsubstitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n<th>Percentage Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross margin</td>\n<td>$ 146,052</td>\n<td>$ 135,620</td>\n<td>8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>152</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 146,204</td>\n<td>$ 135,620</td>\n<td>8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating income</td>\n<td>$ 88,523</td>\n<td>$ 83,383</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>1,171</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 89,694</td>\n<td>$ 83,383</td>\n<td>8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income</td>\n<td>$ 72,361</td>\n<td>$ 72,738</td>\n<td>(1)%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>946</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>(3,291)</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 73,307</td>\n<td>$ 69,447</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diluted earnings per share</td>\n<td>$ 9.68</td>\n<td>$ 9.65</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs</td>\n<td>0.13</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>(0.44)</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 9.81</td>\n<td>$ 9.21</td>\n<td>7%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\\*\nNot meaningful.\n\n\n# LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital\nmarkets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing\nactivities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax\nrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and $104.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist\npredominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual\nissuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-\ndenominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.\nThe credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that\ncorrelate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the\nshort-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n\n\n## Valuation\n\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine\nthe fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S.\ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities\nor inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies\nto our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"45\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\ngovernment bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level\n3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured\nat fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these\nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without\napplying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is\nnot priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the\ninvestment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker\nprices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-\npriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate\nfor these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values\nare recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period\nfluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid\nto employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from\ncustomers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5\nbillion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a\n$1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year\n2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases\nof intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales,\nand maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\n\n\n## Debt Proceeds\n\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and\nthe low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes,\nwhich may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock,\nacquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 11 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n## Unearned Revenue\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include\nSoftware Assurance (\"SA\") and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of\neach contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue\nalso includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we\ntransfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements\n(Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2023:\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Three Months Ending</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>September 30, 2023</td>\n<td>$ 19,673</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>December 31, 2023</td>\n<td>15,600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>March 31, 2024</td>\n<td>10,801</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>June 30, 2024</td>\n<td>4,827</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thereafter</td>\n<td>2,912</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 53,813</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-\nbased products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"46\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nbeing recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years,\nwith 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid\ntransition tax of $7.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. The remaining transition tax of $10.5 billion\nis payable over the next three years, with $2.7 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, we paid cash tax of $4.8 billion due to the mandatory capitalization for tax purposes of research\nand development expenditures enacted by the TCJA and effective on July 1, 2022.\n\n\n### Share Repurchases\n\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 69 million shares and 95 million shares of our common stock for\n$18.4 billion and $28.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using\ncash resources. As of June 30, 2023, $22.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to\nNote 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\n### Dividends\n\nDuring fiscal year 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.68 per share and $0.62\nper share, totaling $20.2 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders\nin the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of\nthe Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n### Other Planned Uses of Capital\n\nOn January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (\"Activision Blizzard\")\nfor $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard's net cash. The\nacquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard's shareholders. We continue to work toward closing the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\ntransaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to\nallow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns.\n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of\ntechnology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will\ncontinue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and\nmarketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support\ngrowth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for\ndatacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain\nequipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or\nother persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\n\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing\nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a\nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment\nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and\nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,\ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for\ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\ncloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We\nuse a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with\nSA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell\neach of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based\non the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services\nby customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain\ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration\nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and\nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n\n### Impairment of Investment Securities\n\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair\nvalue, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"48\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nextent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this\njudgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in\nevaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the\nfinancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than\nnot that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as\nan impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market,\nindustry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment\nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a\nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine\nthe amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded\nin other income (expense), net.\n\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.\nWe evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value\nallocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below\nan operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events\nor circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance\nindicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment\nof assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value\nof each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash\nflow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is\ndependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful\nlife over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,\nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the\ndetermination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until\ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software\ncosts are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining\nwhen technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our\nsoftware products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.\nGenerally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is\nincluded in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\n\n\n## Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated\nloss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that\nan asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nIn determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an\nunfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors\ncould materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the\ncurrent year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"49\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\nin an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is\nmore likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the\ntechnical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are\nmeasured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,\nclassification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax\npositions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that\nhave been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these\nfuture tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory\nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These\nreviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales\nlevels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value,\nwe reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"50\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n# STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that\nare presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management's\nestimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\n\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at\nreasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial\nrecords are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These\nsystems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful\nselection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.\n\nThe Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render\nan opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the\nstandards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\n\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets\nperiodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that\neach is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.\n\nSatya Nadella\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAmy E.

PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n# NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n\n## Accounting Principles\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").\n\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior\nperiod amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated\ncash flows statements.\n\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue\nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the\nstandalone selling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as\nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of\ngoodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible\nassets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based\ncompensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of\nuncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and\ndetermining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from\nmanagement's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments\nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from\nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the\ncarrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the\neffect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income\nof $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\nRevenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments\nresulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n\n## Revenue\n\n\n### Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications,\nserver applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development\ntools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices,\nand related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,\nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services.\nService and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"58\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can\ninclude various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted\nfor as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected\nfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n\n#### Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made\navailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide\ncustomers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the\nsoftware. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is\nmade available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the\nupdates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally\nratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with\nSoftware Assurance (\"SA\"). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and\nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses\nare considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized\nratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises\ndistinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of\nthe software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided\non a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on\na consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization\nof such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software\nand the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud\nservices are provided.\n\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the\naction necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services\nare provided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot\nfunction without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single\nperformance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or\ndirectly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant\nproduct and service offering.\n\n\n#### Significant Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and\nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,\ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for\ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\ncloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"59\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nprovided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and\nservices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of\nthe various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services\nby customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain\ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration\nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and\nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when\nrevenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\nFor multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period.\nWe record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional\nright to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA\nand cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-\nyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for\nconsulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions,\nWindows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in\nadvance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes\nin unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within\n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have\ndetermined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our\ninvoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services,\nnot to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the\nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises\nlicenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion\nand $3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable\nbalance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently\navailable evidence.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"60\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n# Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n\n\n## (In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, beginning of period</td>\n<td>$ 710</td>\n<td>$ 798</td>\n<td>$ 816</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charged to costs and other</td>\n<td>258</td>\n<td>157</td>\n<td>234</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Write-offs</td>\n<td>(252)</td>\n<td>(245)</td>\n<td>(252)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, end of period</td>\n<td>$ 716</td>\n<td>$ 710</td>\n<td>$ 798</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>June 30,</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts</td>\n<td>$ 650</td>\n<td>$ 633</td>\n<td>$ 751</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other long-term assets</td>\n<td>66</td>\n<td>77</td>\n<td>47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 716</td>\n<td>$ 710</td>\n<td>$ 798</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components\nwere $9.2 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance\nsheets.\n\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products\nand services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nour financing receivables, net were $5.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing\nreceivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other\ncurrently available evidence.\n\n\n### Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of\nthose costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the\nrequirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented\nand are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the\namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization\ncompensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is\ncommensurate with annual sales activities.\n\n\n#### Cost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating\ncosts related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on\nPCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\"OEM\"), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising\nspace; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter\ncosts and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting\nservices; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are\namortized over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n\n#### Product Warranty\n\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the\nrelated revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected\nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The\nspecific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"61\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\ndo business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For\nsoftware warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the\nsoftware. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust\nthe amounts as necessary.\n\n\n#### Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and\nother headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also\ninclude third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services\ncontent. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point\nthat technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are\nreleased to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of\nrevenue over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n\n#### Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other\nheadcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,\ntrade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was\n$904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\n\n#### Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units\n(\"PSUs\"), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over\nthe related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common\nstock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We\nmeasure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using\nthe straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\n\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") is measured as the discount the employee is\nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n\n\n##### Employee Severance\n\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through\nthe third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of\nemployee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These\nemployee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross\nmargin. Refer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information.\n\n\n##### Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect\nof such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation\nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified\nas long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\n##### Financial Instruments\n\n\n###### Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase\nto be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments\nwith original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"62\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nshort-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their\nhighly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for\ncurrent operations.\n\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific\nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates\ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors,\ngeneral market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than\ncost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and\nqualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business\noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell\nthe security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other\nincome (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee\nconditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable\nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment\non a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment\nis less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\n\n# Derivatives\n\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense),\nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded\nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of\nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding\nhedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\n\n# Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on\nthe extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair\nvalue measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\n· Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our\nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual\nfunds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n\n· Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.\nthe Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated\nby observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these\nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and\nspot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S.\nagency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and\nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap\ncontracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"63\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\n· Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined\nusing model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level\n3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill\nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable\ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\n\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of\nthese investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include\nquoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory\nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our\nreview indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a\ncharge to cost of revenue.\n\n\n### Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method\nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property\nand equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years;\ncomputer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three\nto 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\n\n\n### Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use\n(\"ROU\") assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance\nleases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nat commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do\nnot provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest\nfor collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease\nROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include\noptions to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense\nfor lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For\ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the\noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\n\n\n### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"64\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n#### Intangible Assets\n\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated\nperiod of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by\ntaking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset\nmay be impaired.\n\n\n##### NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.\nDilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.\n\nThe components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\">(In

Our objectives for holding derivatives include\nreducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our\nderivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\n\n#### Foreign Currencies\n\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign\ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\n\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange\nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-\ndenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging\ninstruments.\n\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign\nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\n\n\n#### Interest Rate\n\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair\nvalue hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\n\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We\nmanage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-\nbased fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"69\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n#### Equity\n\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options,\nfutures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\n\n#### Credit\n\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default\nswap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.\nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n\n#### Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and\noutstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain\nminimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral,\nsimilar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2023, our long-term\nunsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was\nrequired to be posted.\n\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S.

In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis\nCentre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some\ndating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a\nparty to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we\nrecorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India\nSupreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in\nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional\noperations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net\nincome tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions\nresulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in\nIreland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal\nyear 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and\ndistributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax\nbenefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding\ntaxes. In fiscal year 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S.\nrate, generated 81% of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our foreign regional operating\ncenters in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71% and 82% of our\nforeign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year\n2021, includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.\n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3\nbillion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a\ndecrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year\n2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before\nincome taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"79\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nCourt decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing,\nand final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") regulations.\n\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"3\">(In millions)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>June 30,</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred Income Tax Assets</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stock-based compensation expense</td>\n<td>$ 681</td>\n<td>$ 601</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accruals, reserves, and other expenses</td>\n<td>3,131</td>\n<td>2,874</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss and credit carryforwards</td>\n<td>1,441</td>\n<td>1,546</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amortization (a)</td>\n<td>9,440</td>\n<td>10,183</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leasing liabilities</td>\n<td>5,041</td>\n<td>4,557</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unearned revenue</td>\n<td>3,296</td>\n<td>2,876</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt</td>\n<td>373</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capitalized research and development (a)</td>\n<td>6,958</td>\n<td>473</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other</td>\n<td>489</td>\n<td>461</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred income tax assets</td>\n<td>30,850</td>\n<td>23,571</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Less valuation allowance</td>\n<td>(939)</td>\n<td>(1,012)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance</td>\n<td>$ 29,911</td>\n<td>$ 22,559</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred Income Tax Liabilities</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt</td>\n<td>$ 0</td>\n<td>$ (174)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leasing assets</td>\n<td>(4,680)</td>\n<td>(4,291)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depreciation</td>\n<td>(2,674)</td>\n<td>(1,602)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred tax on foreign earnings</td>\n<td>(2,738)</td>\n<td>(3,104)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other</td>\n<td>(89)</td>\n<td>(103)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred income tax liabilities</td>\n<td>$ (10,181)</td>\n<td>$ (9,274)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net deferred income tax assets</td>\n<td>$ 19,730</td>\n<td>$ 13,285</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reported As</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other long-term assets</td>\n<td>$ 20,163</td>\n<td>$ 13,515</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long-term deferred income tax liabilities</td>\n<td>(433)</td>\n<td>(230)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net deferred income tax assets</td>\n<td>$ 19,730</td>\n<td>$ 13,285</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n(a) Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and development\nexpenditures became effective on July 1, 2022.

We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information\ncurrently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues\nwithin the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\nsubject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia's Devices and Services business\nand have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for\ncertain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate\nwithin the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\"FCC Guidelines\") are pre-\nempted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were\nmanufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to\nmanipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\n\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs' expert evidence of general causation\non the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants'\nmotion to exclude the plaintiffs' general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District\nof Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the\nCourt of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to\nthe trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence,\nportions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April\nof 2023, the court granted defendants' motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs' experts that cell phones cause brain\ncancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs' experts from testifying.\n\n\n## Irish Data Protection Commission Matter\n\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (\"IDPC\") began investigating a complaint against Linkedln as to whether\nLinkedIn's targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection\nRegulation (\"GDPR\"). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn\nwith a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends to\nchallenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"84\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our\nbusiness. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will\nnot have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent\nuncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $617 million. While we intend to defend these matters\nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded\namounts are reasonably possible.

During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance\nbased on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal\nComputing.\n\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business.\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\n\n## Productivity and Business Processes\n\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,\ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily\ncomprises:\n\n· Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial\nsubscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft\nTeams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\n· Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other\nOffice services.\n\n· LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.\n\n· Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based\napplications across ERP, CRM (including Customer Insights), Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-\npremises ERP and CRM applications.\n\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can\npower modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n· Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows\nServer, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (\"CALs\"); and Nuance and\nGitHub.\n\n. Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions (formerly Microsoft\nConsulting Services), and Nuance professional services.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"89\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the\nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n· Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating\nsystem; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows\ncloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\n\n· Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.\n\n· Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content\n(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming,\nadvertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services.\n\n. Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and\nthird-party affiliates.\n\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our\nbusiness, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from\ncertain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services,\nwhich can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a\nprofit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating\nexpenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple\nsegments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\nIn addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs\ngenerally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise\ntaxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a\ncorporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs\nbeing allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.\n\nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>(In millions)</th>\n<th colspan=\"3\"></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Productivity and Business Processes</td>\n<td>$ 69,274</td>\n<td>$ 63,364</td>\n<td>$ 53,915</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligent Cloud</td>\n<td>87,907</td>\n<td>74,965</td>\n<td>59,728</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More Personal Computing</td>\n<td>54,734</td>\n<td>59,941</td>\n<td>54,445</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 211,915</td>\n<td>$198,270</td>\n<td>$ 168,088</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating Income</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Productivity and Business Processes</td>\n<td>$ 34,189</td>\n<td>$ 29,690</td>\n<td>$ 24,351</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligent Cloud</td>\n<td>37,884</td>\n<td>33,203</td>\n<td>26,471</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More Personal Computing</td>\n<td>16,450</td>\n<td>20,490</td>\n<td>19,094</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 88,523</td>\n<td>$ 83,383</td>\n<td>$ 69,916</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"90\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 8\n\nNo sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue\nfor fiscal years 2023, 2022, or 2021.

Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters\nbelow, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"92\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or\nservices. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and\nservices, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.\n\nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer\nagreements, and includes the following:\n\n· Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should\nbe accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold\nwith cloud-based services.\n\n· The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.\n\n· Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized\n(e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).\n\n· Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and\nservices that are not sold separately.\n\nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's\njudgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high\ndegree of auditor judgment.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements\nincluded the following:\n\n· We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the\ndetermination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.\n\n· We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for\nreasonableness.\n\n· We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:\n\n\\- Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other\ndocuments that were part of the agreement.\n\n\\- Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.\n\n\\- Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's\napplication of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue\nrecognition conclusions.\n\n· We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and\nservices that are not sold separately.\n\n.

The Company remains under IRS audit, or\nsubject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits,\nresolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management\njudgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws,\nand prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues\nthat remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of\nuncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including\ninvolvement of our tax specialists.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to\nunresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\n\n. We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the\nidentification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the\neffectiveness of the related internal controls.\n\n. We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information\nobtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n· We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain\ntax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n. For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management\nhad appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement\nor disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n· We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes,\nregulations and case law, impacted management's judgments.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"94\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 9, 9A\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 9.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable\ndetail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and\nexpenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable\nassurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our\nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023. There were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial\nreporting as of June 30, 2023; their report is included in Item 9A.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"95\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 9A\n\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\n### To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation\n\n\n#### Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the\n\"Company\") as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,\n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, of\nthe Company and our report dated July 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n\n#### Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\n\n\n#### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 27, 2023\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"96\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II, III Item 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 9B.
